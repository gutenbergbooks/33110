<h2>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</h2>

<p>The numbers in the right margin refer to the page numbers of the original printed book, they appear just where the corresponding page begins, e.g., <a href="#pg_113">page 113</a> contains the text between “p. 113” and “p. 114”.</p>

<p>The illustrations in the printed book were placed in unnumbered pages inserted between the numbered text pages (the <a href="#ill-1">first illustration</a> was in the frontispiece). In this version the illustrations have been inserted right after the passage they refer to.</p>

<p>At the <a href="#ads">end of the book</a> there are several pages of advertisement for other books of the publisher, these pages have an independent numbering in the printed book, here they are numbered 1′–22′.</p>

<p>In the present edition some typographic errors or inconsistencies have been corrected. In the HTML version these corrections are marked with <ins title="Example of correction">a dotted underline</ins>, and the printed text usually appears in a “pop-up hint” when hovering the cursor on it.</p>

CORPORAL ’LIGE’S RECRUIT.

<h2 id="chapter-1">CHAPTER I.
<span class="title">RECRUITING.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">There</span> was great excitement among the
citizens of the town of Pittsfield in the
province of Massachusetts on the first day of
May in the year 1775.</p>

<p>Master Edward Mott and Noah Phelps,
forming a committee appointed by the Provincial
Assembly of Connecticut, had arrived
on the previous evening charged with an
important commission, the making known of
which had so aroused the inhabitants of the
peaceful settlement that it was as if the
reports of the muskets fired at Lexington and
Concord were actually ringing in their ears.</p>

<p>These two gentlemen had with them a
<span id="pg_2" class="page_anchor">2 </span>
following of sixteen men, equipped as if for
battle, and the arrival of so large an armed
body had aroused the curiosity of the good
people until all were painfully eager to learn
the reason for what seemed little less than
an invasion.</p>

<p>When it was whispered around that Master
Mott and Phelps had, immediately upon their
arrival, inquired for Colonel James Easton
and Master John Brown, and were even then
closeted with those citizens, the more knowing
ones predicted that this coming had much
to do with the warlike preparations that
were making in Boston and New York,
designed to put a check upon the unlawful
doings of his majesty the king.</p>

<p>When morning came, that is to say, on this
first day of May, it was generally understood
throughout the settlement that the Provincial
Assembly of Connecticut had agreed upon a
<span id="pg_3" class="page_anchor">3 </span>
plan to seize the munitions of war at Ticonderoga
for the use of that body of men
known as the American army, then gathered
at Cambridge and Roxbury in the province of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The gossips of Pittsfield stated that one
thousand dollars had been advanced from
the Provincial Treasury of Connecticut to
pay the expenses of the expedition; that the
sixteen men making up the following of the
committee were recruits who had pledged
themselves to capture this important fortress
which formed the key of communication
between New York and the Canadas, and
that they proposed to march through the
country to Shoreham, opposite Ticonderoga,
recruiting as they went, with the belief that
on arriving there their force would be sufficiently
large to capture the fort.</p>

<p>The boys as well as the men were highly
<span id="pg_4" class="page_anchor">4 </span>
excited, as was but natural, by such rumors,
and a certain Isaac Rice, who prided himself
upon being fourteen years old, instead of
gathering with his companions, listening
eagerly to every word which dropped from
the lips of the older members of the community,
conceived the idea of applying to
what he believed to be the fountain-head of
all information regarding military matters.</p>

<p>This supposedly wise man was none other
than Corporal Elijah Watkins, generally
known as “Corporal ’Lige,” sometimes
spoken of as “Master Watkins;” but always
to Isaac Rice, “the corporal.”</p>

<p>He was looked upon as an old man when
he served under Abercrombie at Ticonderoga
in ’58, and believed of a surety he was as
well informed in military affairs as Isaac
Rice, his ardent disciple, fancied him to
be.</p>

<span id="pg_5" class="page_anchor">5 </span>

<p>Ever ready to give advice on important
matters; not backward about criticising the
alleged mistakes of his superiors, and holding
himself as with the idea that during the
late troubles with the French he had learned
all the art of warfare; but yet with such
possibly disagreeable qualities, Corporal
’Lige had shown himself to be a brave soldier,
willing at any time to do more even than was
his duty.</p>

<p>The old man was sitting outside the door
of a tiny log building which he called home,
smoking peacefully, much as he might have
done had the committee from Connecticut
never passed that way, and this apparent
indifference surprised the boy.</p>

<p>“Why, corporal, don’t you know what’s
going on in the town? Haven’t you heard
that they are talking of taking the fort at
Ticonderoga, and running the king out of the
country?”</p>

<span id="pg_6" class="page_anchor">6 </span>

<p>“First and foremost, Isaac lad, are you so
ignorant as to think the king is here in this
’ere province to be run out? An’ then agin,
can’t you realize that talkin’s one thing an’
doin’s another?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but, corporal, haven’t you heard the
news?”</p>

<p>“If you mean so far as concerns the committee
from Connecticut, Isaac, I have heard
it, and what’s more, Master Noah Phelps
talked with me before ever he went to see
Colonel Easton. He knew where he could
get information about Ticonderoga, for bless
your soul, lad, wasn’t I there in ’58? An’
would you find a stick or stone around the
place that I can’t call to mind?”</p>

<p>“Did Master Phelps come to see you first?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, lad, it ’mounted to much the
same thing. I was down the road when he
come into town, an’ seein’ me he acted like
<span id="pg_7" class="page_anchor">7 </span>
as if a great load had been lifted off his shoulders,
’cause he knowed I could tell him a
thing or two if I was minded. ‘Good-evenin’
to you, Corporal ’Lige,’ he said sweet as
honey in the honeycomb, and I passed the
time of day with him, kind of suspicionin’
something of this same business was goin’
on. ‘Want to take a little trip up through
the country?’ he asked friendly-like, and do
you know, lad, the whole plan come to me in
a minute, an’ I says to him, says I, ‘Master
Phelps, you can count me in, if it so be yo’re
goin’ toward the lakes.’ ‘That’s where
we’re bound for, Corporal ’Lige,’ says he,
‘and I’ll put your name down.’ I said, says
I, ‘It’s rations, an’ somethin’ in the way of
pay, I reckon?’ an’ he allowed as that part of
it would be all fixed, especially with me,
’cause you see, lad, it wouldn’t be much
good for these people what never knew anything
<span id="pg_8" class="page_anchor">8 </span>
’bout war, to start out leavin’ me
behind. Why, bless your heart, I allow that’s
why they come through Pittsfield, jest for
the purpose of seein’ Corporal ’Lige.”</p>

<p>The old man ceased speaking to puff dense
volumes of smoke from his pipe, and Isaac
Rice gazed at him in wonder and amaze.</p>

<p>That the committee from Connecticut had
visited the town for the sole and only reason
of inducing the corporal to join the force,
there was no question in his mind, and now,
more implicitly than ever before, did he
believe that throughout all the provinces
there could be found no abler soldier than
Corporal ’Lige.</p>

<p>“Yes, lad, I’m goin’ with the committee,
more to tell ’em what they ought to do, as
you might say, than to serve as a private
soldier, for you see I know Ticonderoga root
and branch. I could tell you the whole story
<span id="pg_9" class="page_anchor">9 </span>
from the meanin’ of the name down to who
is in command of it this very minute, if there
was time.”</p>

<p>“But there is, corporal. The committee
are talkin’ to Colonel Easton and Master
Brown now, and don’t count on leaving here
before to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What do they want of the colonel?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but they are stopping at
his house.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t sayin’ but that the colonel is as
good a soldier as you’ll find around here; but
bless your soul, lad, though it ain’t for me
to say it, he could learn considerable from
Corporal ’Lige if he was to spend a few hours
every now and then listenin’.”</p>

<p>“But tell me all you can about Ticonderoga,
corporal.”</p>

<p>The old man looked around furtively as if
half-expecting the committee from Connecticut,
<span id="pg_10" class="page_anchor">10 </span>
or Colonel Easton, might be coming to
ask his advice on some disputed point, and
then, shaking his forefinger now and again at
the lad much as though to prevent contradiction,
he began:</p>

<p>“In the first place the folks ’round here call
it ‘Ticonderoga’ when it ain’t anything of the
kind. The real name is ‘Cheonderoga,’ which
is Iroquois lingo for ‘Sounding Water,’ being
called so, I allow, because the falls at Lake
George make a deal of noise. The French
built breastworks there in ’55, which they
christened Fort Carillon. Now you see it’s a
mighty strong place owin’ to the situation,
and its bein’ located on a point which, so I’ve
heard said, rises more’n a hundred feet above
the level of the water. The solid part of it—that
is to say, the land—is only about five
hundred acres. Three sides are surrounded
by water, an’ in the rear is a swamp. That
<span id="pg_11" class="page_anchor">11 </span>
much for the advantages of the spot, so to
speak. Now I was there in July of ’58 when
Montcalm held the fort with four thousand
men. Lord Howe was second in command of
General Abercrombie’s forces, and Major
Putnam, down here, was with the crowd.
That’s when the major wouldn’t let his lordship
go into the battle first; but banged right
along ahead until we come to the first breastworks,
finding it so strong that the troops
were marched back to the landin’ place and
went into bivouac for the night. It was the
sixth day of July; on the eighth we tried it
again; but the fort couldn’t be carried, an’
the blood that was shed there, lad, all under
the British flag, would come pretty nigh
drownin’ every man, woman an’ child in this
’ere settlement. On the twenty-sixth of
July in the year 1759, General Amherst with
eleven thousand men scared the French out;
<span id="pg_12" class="page_anchor">12 </span>
they didn’t fire a gun, but abandoned the
fortification and fled to Crown Point. Since
that time the king’s forces have held it.”</p>

<p>“How many are there now?” Isaac asked,
not so much for the purpose of gaining information
as to tempt the old man to continue
his story.</p>

<p>“I can’t rightly say, lad, though it’s somewhere
in the neighborhood of fifty. The
commandant is, or was when I last heard,
one Captain Delaplace, and it is said that
he’s a thorough soldier, though I’m allowin’
he hasn’t got any too much of a force with
him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the Connecticut gentlemen
can raise men enough between here and there
to take a fort which resisted General Abercrombie’s
entire army?”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen, lad. If they are
willin’ to act on such advice as can be got
<span id="pg_13" class="page_anchor">13 </span>
from some people hereabouts, I allow there’s
a good chance for it, more especially if the
Green Mountain boys take a hand in the
matter, as Master Phelps thinks probable. In
that case Colonel Ethan Allen would most
likely be in command.”</p>

<p>“And you are really going, corporal?”
asked Isaac.</p>

<p>“Yes, lad, it don’t seem as though I ought
to hang back back when I’m needed. If all
we hear from the other provinces is true,
you’ll be old enough to take a hand in the
scrimmage before the fightin’s over, so here’s
a chance to serve an apprenticeship. If it so
be you’re of the mind I’ll take you under my
wing, an’ by the time we get back you’ll
have a pretty decently good idea of a soldier’s
trade.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean it, corporal?” and
Isaac sprang to his feet in excitement. “Do
<span id="pg_14" class="page_anchor">14 </span>
you really mean that I may go with you just
as if I was of age to carry a gun?”</p>

<p>“Ay, lad, if it so be your mother an’ father
are willin’, an’ I can’t see why they shouldn’t
agree, seein’s how they know the company
you’ll be in. It would seem different if you
talked of goin’ with the general run of recruits,
who are green hands at this kind of
work.”</p>

<p>“But will the committee allow a lad of my
age to go as a soldier?”</p>

<p>“Isaac, my boy, when Corporal ’Lige says
to Master Phelps, says he, ‘This ’ere lad is
goin’ under my wing, so to speak,’ why bless
your heart, that’s the end of the whole business.
They’ve got to have me, an’ won’t
stand out about your joinin’ when it’s known
my heart is set on it.”</p>

<p>“Will you come now while I ask my
mother?”</p>

<span id="pg_15" class="page_anchor">15 </span>

<p>“Well, lad, I ain’t prepared to say as how I
will; but this much I’m promisin’: Go to
her an’ find out how she’s feelin’ about the
matter. If there’s any waverin’ in her mind
I’ll step in—you see I’ll be the reserves in
this case—an’ when I charge she’s bound to
surrender. But if it so happens that she’s
dead set against it at the start, why, you had
best not vex her by tryin’ to push the
matter.”</p>

<p>Having perfect faith in the corporal’s wisdom
Isaac was thoroughly satisfied with
this decision, and after the old man had
promised to await his return at that point,
the lad set out for home at full speed.</p>

<p>Perhaps if Isaac had been the only son of
his mother he would have found it difficult to
gain her permission for such an adventure as
Corporal ’Lige had proposed.</p>

<p>There were five other boys in the family,
<span id="pg_16" class="page_anchor">16 </span>
and Isaac was neither the oldest nor the
youngest.</p>

<p>The fact that Mrs. Rice had so many did
not cause her to be unmindful of any, but
less timorous perhaps, about parting with
one.</p>

<p>However it may be, the lad gained the
desired permission providing his father would
assent, and this last was little more than a
formality.</p>

<p>Master Rice was found among the throng of
citizens in front of the inn where recruiting
was going on briskly.</p>

<p>The opportunity served to give the good
man a certain semblance of patriotism when
he showed himself willing that one of his
sons should go for a soldier, and he would
have had the boy sign the rolls then and
there, but that Isaac demurred.</p>

<p>It was not in his mind to enlist save in the
<span id="pg_17" class="page_anchor">17 </span>
company and after being again assured of the
corporal’s protection, therefore he insisted
on presenting himself as the old man’s recruit
rather than his father’s offering.</p>

<p>Corporal ’Lige was well pleased when
Isaac returned with a detailed account of all
that had taken place, and said approvingly:</p>

<p>“You have shown yourself to be a lad of
rare discretion, Isaac Rice, and I will take it
upon myself to see that such forethought
brings due reward. Suppose you had signed
the rolls at the inn? What would you be
then? Nothin’ more than a private.”</p>

<p>“But that is all I shall be when I sign them
with you, corporal.”</p>

<p>“It may appear that way, I’m free to admit
lad; but still you will be a deal higher than
any non-commissioned officer, because you’ll
be under my wing, and when we have taken
Ticonderoga, though I ain’t admitting that’s
<span id="pg_18" class="page_anchor">18 </span>
the proper name of the fort—when we’ve
taken that, I say, you’ll be fit for any kind of
a commission that you’re qualified to hold.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Isaac replied doubtfully, and then
he fell to speculating as to whether even
though Corporal ’Lige did not “take him
under his wing,” he might not be fit to fill
any position for which “he was qualified.”</p>

<p>While he was thus musing a messenger
came from Master Phelps saying the recruiting
was coming to an end in this town, and
the party would set out that same afternoon
on their way to Bennington, expecting to
enlist volunteers from Colonel Easton’s regiment
of militia as they passed through the
country.</p>

<p>“Never you fear but that I’ll be right at
my post of duty when the command is given
to form ranks,” Corporal ’Lige said to the
messenger, and after the latter had departed
<span id="pg_19" class="page_anchor">19 </span>
he added as he turned to the boy, “Now,
Isaac, lad, you can see what they think of
Corporal ’Lige. Colonel Easton and Master
Brown are hangin’ ’round the inn instead of
waitin’ for the committee to visit them. An’
what do I do? Why, I stay quietly here,
knowin’ they can’t well get along without
me, an’ instead of coolin’ my heels among a
lot of raw recruits, I’m sent for when the
time is come, as if I was a staff officer.
That’s one thing you want to bear in mind.
If you don’t count yourself of any importance,
other people are mighty apt to pass
you by as a ne’er-do-well.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t enlisted yet, corporal.”</p>

<p>“Of course you have. When you said to
me ‘I’m ready to go as your apprentice in this
’ere business,’ it was jest the same as if you’d
signed the rolls. I’ll arrange all that matter
with Master Phelps, my lad. Now do you
<span id="pg_20" class="page_anchor">20 </span>
hasten home; get what you can pick up in
the way of an outfit; borrow your father’s
gun, and kind of mention the fact to your
mother that the more she gives in the way of
provisions the better you’ll be fed, for you
an’ me are likely to mess together.”</p>

<p>“How much are you going to take, corporal?”</p>

<p>“That will depend a good deal on what
kind of a supply your mother furnishes. I’m
willin’ to admit she’s nigh on to as good a
cook as can be found in Pittsfield, an’ will
take my chances on what she puts up for
you, providin’ there’s enough of it.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are to take your musket?”</p>

<p>“I should be a pretty poor kind of a soldier
if I didn’t, lad—the same one I used under
Abercrombie,” and he pointed with his
thumb toward the interior of the dwelling
where, as Isaac knew, a well-worn weapon
<span id="pg_21" class="page_anchor">21 </span>
hung on hooks just over the fireplace. “It’s
one of the king’s arms, an’ I reckon will do
as good service against him as it did for him,
which is saying considerable, lad, as Major
Putnam can vouch for. Now set about
making ready, for we two above all others
must not be behind-hand when the column
moves.”</p>

<p>A fine thing it was to be a soldier, so Isaac
thought as he went leisurely from Corporal
’Lige’s log hut to his home; he was forced to
pass through the entire length of the village,
stopping here and there to acquaint a friend
with what he believed to be a most important
fact.</p>

<p>Among all the lads in Pittsfield of about
his own age he was the only one who proposed
to enlist, and from all he heard and
saw there could be no question but that he
was envied by his companions.</p>

<span id="pg_22" class="page_anchor">22 </span>

<p>From the youngest boy to the oldest man,
the citizens were in such a ferment of excitement
as gave recruits the idea that to enlist
was simply providing amusement for themselves
during a certain number of days, and,
with the exception of those experienced in
such matters, no person believed for a
moment that the brave ones who were rallying
at their country’s call would suffer hardships
or privations.</p>

<p>In fact, this going forth to capture the fort
at Ticonderoga was to be a pleasure excursion
rather than anything else, and Isaac Rice
believed he was the most fortunate lad in the
province of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>His outfit did not require that his mother
should spend very much time upon it.</p>

<p>The clothes he wore comprised the only
suit he owned, and when two shirts and three
pairs of stockings had been made into a parcel
<span id="pg_23" class="page_anchor">23 </span>
of the smallest possible size, and he had
borrowed his father’s gun, powder horn and
shot pouch, the equipment was complete.</p>

<p>Then came the most important of the
preparations, to Isaac’s mind, for he knew
the corporal would criticize it closely—the
store of provisions.</p>

<p>Had he been allowed his own bent the
remainder of the Rice family might have
been put on short allowance, for, with a view
to pleasing the corporal, he urged that this
article of food, and then that, should be put
into the bag which served him as a haversack,
until the larder must have been <ins title="Note: “comletely” in the original">completely</ins>
emptied but for his mother’s emphatic
refusal to follow such suggestions.</p>

<p>If Mrs. Rice did not shed bitter tears over
Isaac when he left her to join the recruits, it
was because she shared the opinion of many
others in Pittsfield, and felt positive the lad
<span id="pg_24" class="page_anchor">24 </span>
would soon return, none the worse for his
short time of soldiering.</p>

<p>It was but natural she should take a most
affectionate farewell of him, however, even
though believing he would be in no especial
danger, and a glimpse of the tears which his
mother could not restrain caused an uncomfortable
swelling in the would-be <ins title="Note: “soldiers’” in the original">soldier’s</ins>
throat.</p>

<p>This leaving home, even to march away by
the side of Corporal ’Lige, was not as pleasant
as he had supposed, and for the moment he
ceased to so much as think of the provision-bag.</p>

<p>“Now, see here, mother,” he said, with a
brave attempt at indifference. “I’m not
counting on doing anything more than help
take the fort, and since the corporal is to be
with us, that can’t be a long task.”</p>

<p>“You will ever be a good boy, Isaac?”</p>

<span id="pg_25" class="page_anchor">25 </span>

<p>“Of course, mother.”</p>

<p>“And you will write me a letter, if it so be
you find the opportunity?”</p>

<p>This was not a pleasing prospect to the
boy, for he had never found it an easy task
to make a fair copy of the single line set
down at the top of his writing-book; but his
heart was sore for the moment, and he would
have promised even more in order to check
his mother’s tears.</p>

<p>Therefore it was he agreed to make her
acquainted with all his movements, so far as
should be possible, and, that done, it seemed
as if the sting was taken in a great measure
from the parting.</p>

<p>Feeling more like a man than ever before
in his life, Isaac set forth from his home
with a heavy musket over his shoulder, and
the bag of provisions hanging at his back,
glancing neither to the right nor to the left
<span id="pg_26" class="page_anchor">26 </span>
until he arrived at the corporal’s dwelling.</p>

<p>An exclamation of surprise and delight
burst from his lips when he saw the old man,
armed and equipped as he had been in ’58,
wearing the uniform of a British soldier, even
though by thus setting out he was proving
his disloyalty to the king.</p>

<p>“Well you do look fine, corporal. I dare
wager there are none who will set forth from
this town as much a soldier as you!”</p>

<p>“I reckon Colonel Easton will come out
great with his militia uniform; but what does
it amount to except for the value of the gold
lace that’s on it? All I’m wearin’ has seen
service, an’ though it ain’t for me to say it,
I shouldn’t be <ins title="Note: “suprised” in the original">surprised</ins> if him as is inside
this ’ere red coat could tell the militia colonel
much regarding his duty.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can, corporal, every one
<span id="pg_27" class="page_anchor">27 </span>
knows that, an’ I’m expecting to see you put
next in command to Colonel Allen, if it so be
he goes.”</p>

<p>“Not quite that, lad, not quite that, for
there’s jealousy in the ranks the same as outside
of them, though I warrant many of ’em
will be glad to ask Corporal ’Lige’s advice
before this ’ere business is over. Now let’s
have a look to your stores, and we’ll be
off.”</p>

<p>The examination of the impromptu haversack
appeared to be satisfactory to the old
man, and without doing more in the way of
securing his dwelling from intruders than
shutting the outer door, he marched down
the street with such a swagger as he evidently
believed befitting a soldier.</p>

<p>THE OLD MAN MARCHED DOWN THE STREET WITH SUCH A SWAGGER AS HE EVIDENTLY
BELIEVED BEFITTING A SOLDIER.</p>
<p class="place"><em>Corporal ’Lige’s Recruit, p. 27.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Isaac followed meekly at his heels, troubling
his head not one whit because he lacked
a uniform, but believing he shared to a certain
<span id="pg_28" class="page_anchor">28 </span>
degree in Corporal ’Lige’s gorgeousness
and martial bearing.</p>

<p>The two came to a halt outside the inn,
standing stiffly at “attention,” and there
they remained until Master Phelps was
forced to go out and bid the old man enter,
that the formality of signing the rolls might
be gone through with, after which Isaac Rice
was duly entitled to call himself a militiaman.</p>

<span id="pg_29" class="page_anchor">29 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-2">CHAPTER II.
<span class="title">A SECLUDED CAMP.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">When</span> these raw recruits departed from
the town—Corporal ’Lige insisted that they
did not march—they were followed for several
miles by nearly all the men and boys in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>The old man was greatly exercised because
Colonel Easton, who now assumed command,
allowed such an unsoldierly proceeding as
that his troops should walk arm in arm with
their friends, each in his own manner and at
his own convenience.</p>

<p>Had the corporal been invested with the
proper authority he would have had these
raw recruits marshaled into ranks and forced
<span id="pg_30" class="page_anchor">30 </span>
to step in unison, carrying their muskets at
the same angle, and otherwise conforming
themselves to his idea of soldierly bearing—all
this he would have had them do; but
whether he could have brought about such
a condition of affairs is extremely problematical.</p>

<p>“I allowed Colonel James Easton came
somewhere near bein’ a soldier, even though
he is only a militiaman,” the corporal said in
a tone of intense dissatisfaction to Isaac as
the two marched solemnly side by side in the
midst of their disorderly companions, “and I
did think we could set out from here and
capture Ticonderoga, if all hands were willin’
to put their shoulders to the wheel; but I
take back that statement, lad, and am sorry
I ever was so foolish as to enlist. I ought to
have known better when I saw the crowd
that was signin’ the rolls.”</p>

<span id="pg_31" class="page_anchor">31 </span>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, corporal?” and
Isaac looked around in surprise, for until this
moment he had believed everything was
progressing in proper military fashion.</p>

<p>“Matter?” Corporal ’Lige cried angrily.
“Look around and see how these men are
comportin’ themselves, an’ then you’ll know.
Here are them as should be soldiers, seein’s
they’ve signed the rolls, mixed up with
citizens till you couldn’t tell one from the
other unless personally acquainted with all
hands. Then how are they marchin’? Why,
a flock of geese couldn’t straggle along in any
more ungainly fashion.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t suppose it would make any
difference how they marched so that they got
there in time,” Isaac ventured to suggest
timidly.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t, eh? Then what’s the good of
calling themselves soldiers? Why don’t
<span id="pg_32" class="page_anchor">32 </span>
they start out like a crowd of farmers an’ try
their hand at taking the fort?”</p>

<p>“Well?” Isaac replied calmly. “Why
shouldn’t they? They are not soldiers, you
know, corporal, and so long’s the fort is taken
why wouldn’t it be as well if they didn’t try
to ape military manners?”</p>

<p>The old man gazed sternly at the boy while
one might have counted ten, and then said in
a tone of sadness:</p>

<p>“It’s a shame, Isaac Rice, that after bein’
with me all these years, an’ hearin’ more or
less regardin’ military matters, you shouldn’t
have more sense.”</p>

<p>“Why, what have I said now, corporal? Is
it any harm to think that farmers might take
a fort?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is, lad. If anything of that
kind could happen, what’s the use of having
soldiers?”</p>

<span id="pg_33" class="page_anchor">33 </span>

<p>“But I suppose it is necessary to have an
army if there’s going to be war,” Isaac
replied innocently, and this last was sufficient
to completely fill the vials of the old man’s
wrath.</p>

<p>That this pupil of his should fail at the
very first opportunity to show a proper spirit,
was to him most disappointing, and during
the half-hour which followed he refused to
speak, even though Isaac alternately begged
his pardon for having been so ignorant and
expressed regret that he had said anything
which might give offense.</p>

<p>During all this while the citizens of Pittsfield
were following the recruits in a most
friendly manner, believing it their duty to
thus cheer those who might soon be amid the
carnage of battle, and perhaps not one realized
how seriously he was by such method
offending Corporal ’Lige.</p>

<span id="pg_34" class="page_anchor">34 </span>

<p>Isaac’s father was among this well-intentioned
following, as were two of the lad’s
brothers, and when these representatives of
the Rice family, having walked as far as the
head of the household deemed necessary,
were about to turn back, they ranged themselves
either side of the corporal and his
pupil, in order to bid the latter farewell.</p>

<p>“I expect you will give a good account of
yourself, Isaac, when it comes to fighting,
and I feel all the more confident in regard to
it because you are under the wing of a man
who knows what it is to be a soldier.”</p>

<p>This compliment was intended for Corporal
’Lige as a matter of course; but he paid
no other attention to it than to say:</p>

<p>“If the lad had profited by my teachings,
he’d know that he has no right to talk with
outsiders while he’s in the ranks.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly it,” Mr. Rice replied,
<span id="pg_35" class="page_anchor">35 </span>
wholly oblivious that the corporal was administering
what he believed to be a most severe
rebuke. “That is exactly it, my son, and
you will do well to remember that you cannot
fail in your duty so long as you take
pattern from the corporal.”</p>

<p>The old soldier gave vent to what can be
described only as a “snort” of contempt;
and the boy’s sorrow was as nothing compared
with what it had been when bidding
good-by to his mother.</p>

<p>After the young Rices had turned their
faces homeward in obedience to the orders
of the elder Rice, Isaac gave more heed to
copying the movements of the corporal,
thereby atoning in a certain measure for his
previous injudicious remarks.</p>

<p>The boy firmly believed that no more able
soldier could be found in all the colonies than
this same Corporal ’Lige, and had any person
<span id="pg_36" class="page_anchor">36 </span>
ventured to remark that the expedition might
be as well off without him, Isaac would have
set the speaker down as one lacking common
sense.</p>

<p>Take the corporal out of the ranks, and
young Rice would have said there was no
possibility either Crown Point or Ticonderoga
could be captured.</p>

<p>Thus it was that an order from Colonel Allen,
Colonel Easton, or Seth Warner was as nothing
compared with one from Corporal ’Lige, in
the mind of Isaac Rice; but there were many
in the ranks who did not have such an exalted
opinion of the old soldier, and these were
free with their criticisms and unfavorable
remarks, much against the raw recruit’s
peace of mind, as well as the corporal’s
annoyance.</p>

<p>It was because of these light-headed volunteers,
who saw only in this expedition a
<span id="pg_37" class="page_anchor">37 </span>
novel and agreeable form of junketing, out of
which it was their duty to extract all the
sport possible regardless of the feelings of
others, that Corporal ’Lige withdrew himself,
so to speak, from his comrades, and barely
acknowledged the salutes of any save his
superior officers.</p>

<p>At the end of the second day’s journey he
refused to go into camp with them; but
applied to the captain of his company for
permission to advance yet a short distance
further, at which point he could join the
troops when they came forward next morning.
It was known by all the expedition, even
including those who were making the old
soldier the butt of their mirth, that he was
held in high esteem by Colonel Ethan Allen,
and the request, although irregular, was
readily granted, after a warning against the
perils attendant upon such a course.</p>

<span id="pg_38" class="page_anchor">38 </span>

<p>“It is better you stay with the troops, corporal,”
the captain said kindly, “although I
have no hesitation in saying you are free to
do as you choose.”</p>

<p>“And I do not choose to remain in the
encampment for all the young geese—who
fancy that by signing the rolls they have
become soldiers—to sharpen their wits upon,
therefore I would halt by myself, taking only
the recruit I claim as my own, for company.”</p>

<p>“I will have a care that you are not
annoyed again,” the officer replied in a
kindly tone; but this was not to Corporal
’Lige’s liking.</p>

<p>“If a soldier can only keep his self-respect
by running to his superior officers like a
schoolboy when matters are not to his fancy
it is time he left the ranks. After we have
smelt burning powder I fancy these youngsters
<span id="pg_39" class="page_anchor">39 </span>
will keep a civil tongue in their heads,
and until then I had best care for myself.”</p>

<p>This was such good logic that the captain
could oppose no solid argument against it,
therefore the old soldier received permission
for himself and “his recruit” to form camp
wherever it should please him, provided,
however, that they remained in the ranks
while the command was advancing.</p>

<p>Not until after the matter had been thus
settled did the captain take it upon himself
to warn the corporal that it was not wholly
safe to thus separate from his companions.</p>

<p>“It is well known that our movements are
being watched by both Tories and Indians,”
he said in a friendly manner, such as would
not offend the obstinate old soldier, “and
you can well fancy that they would not hesitate
to do some mischief to any of the expedition
whom they might come upon alone.”</p>

<span id="pg_40" class="page_anchor">40 </span>

<p>“I can take care of myself, and also the
boy,” Corporal ’Lige replied stiffly, as he
saluted his superior officer with unusual
gravity, and with this the subject was
dropped.</p>

<p>Then the old man said to his recruit, as he
motioned him aside that others might not get
information concerning his purpose:</p>

<p>“We’ll draw such rations as may be served
out, lad, and then push ahead to where we can
be in the company of sensible people, meaning
our two selves.”</p>

<p>Isaac would have felt decidedly more safe
if he could remain with the main body of
troops, for he had heard the captain’s caution;
but he did not think it wise to give
such a desire words, and by his silence signified
that he was ready to do whatsoever his
instructor should deem to be for the best.</p>

<p>The rations served these volunteers who
<span id="pg_41" class="page_anchor">41 </span>
proposed to reduce the forts at Ticonderoga
and Crown Point ere they yet knew a soldier’s
duties were not generous, and he who,
from a desire to avoid seeming greedy,
delayed in applying for them, generally
found himself without food, save he might
be so fortunate as to beg some from his more
provident companions.</p>

<p>Corporal ’Lige was exceedingly friendly to
his stomach; he made it a rule never to allow
modesty to deprive him of a full share of
whatever might be served out, therefore it
was he had drawn rations for himself and
Isaac almost before the troops came to a halt,
and the hindermost were yet marching into
camp, weary and travel-stained, when he said
to his small comrade:</p>

<p>“There is nothing to keep us here longer,
and the sooner we are at a goodly distance
from these silly youngsters who fancy that
<span id="pg_42" class="page_anchor">42 </span>
the taking of a musket in their hands
makes them soldiers, the better I shall be
pleased.”</p>

<p>Isaac gave token of willingness to continue
the march by shouldering his weapon
once more, and the two set off, attracting
no attention from their companions-in-arms,
each of whom had little thought save to
minister to his own comfort, for this soldiering
was rapidly becoming more of a task and
less of a pleasure-tour than had been at first
supposed.</p>

<p>Not until he was fully a mile from the
foremost of the main body did the corporal
give any evidence of an intention to halt, and
then he showed remarkably good judgment
in his selection of a camping-place.</p>

<p>At the edge of a small brook about fifty
yards from the main road over which they
had been traveling, he threw down his knapsack,
<span id="pg_43" class="page_anchor">43 </span>
and announced in a tone of satisfaction
that they would spend the night there.</p>

<p>“It is not too far away, and yet at such a
distance that we shall not be forced to listen
to the gabbling of those geese,” he said as
he set about building a small campfire in
order to prepare the food he had procured.
“Make yourself comfortable, Isaac Rice,
for it is a soldier’s solemn duty to gain all
the rest he can.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we shall be safe here?” the
boy asked almost timidly, for it seemed
little short of a crime to question any proposition
made by the corporal.</p>

<p>“Safe, lad? What’s to prevent? If you
keep your ears open for stories of danger
while you are with the army, you’ll never
know peace of mind, for there are always
those faint-hearted ones ready to exaggerate
the falling of a leaf into the coming of the
<span id="pg_44" class="page_anchor">44 </span>
enemy. I have as much regard for my own
safety as for yours, and I say that here we
can camp in peace and safety.”</p>

<p>This was sufficient for the corporal’s
recruit, and he set about making himself
comfortable, with the conviction that none
knew better than his comrade the general
condition of affairs.</p>

<span id="pg_45" class="page_anchor">45 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-3">CHAPTER III.
<span class="title">AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Surely</span> this camping by themselves was
exceedingly pleasant, Isaac thought, as the
old soldier took upon himself the duties of
cook, leaving his recruit with nothing to do
save watch him as he worked.</p>

<p>On the previous night they had slept in the
midst of a noisy throng who chattered and
made merry until an exceedingly late hour,
thus preventing the more weary from sleeping,
and everywhere in the air, hanging like
clouds, was the dust raised by the feet of so
many men.</p>

<p>Now these two were in the seclusion of the
woods, with a carpet of grass for a bed; the
<span id="pg_46" class="page_anchor">46 </span>
rippling brook to lull them to slumber, and
nothing more noisy than the insect life everywhere
around to disturb their slumbers.</p>

<p>Corporal ’Lige was in a rare good humor.
He prepared an appetizing meal, although
his materials were none of the best, and
when it had been eaten, seated himself by
Isaac’s side with pipe in his mouth, ready
and willing to spin yarns of his previous
experience as a soldier.</p>

<p>The boy was an eager listener; but after a
certain time even the tones of the old soldier’s
voice were not sufficient to banish the
sleep elves, and his eyes closed in unconsciousness
just when his comrade had arrived
at the most exciting portion of his narrative.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shan’t be so willin’ the next
time you want to hear what I’ve seen in this
world,” Corporal ’Lige said testily when he
observed that his audience was asleep, and
<span id="pg_47" class="page_anchor">47 </span>
then, knocking the ashes carefully from his
pipe, he lay down by the side of his small
companion.</p>

<p>It seemed to Isaac that he had hardly more
than closed his eyes in unconsciousness
when he was aroused by the pressure of
some heavy substance upon his hand, and
looking up quickly he saw, in the dim light,
three men standing over the corporal.</p>

<p>The foot of one of these strangers was
upon the boy’s hand, as if he did not think
Isaac of sufficient importance either to warrant
his taking him prisoner, or to so much
as step aside that he might be spared pain.</p>

<p>Before hearing a single word, Isaac understood
that these late-comers were no friends
of the corporal’s, and he endured the pain in
silence, hoping that by so doing he might
escape observation.</p>

<p>It was hardly probable the strangers failed
<span id="pg_48" class="page_anchor">48 </span>
to see him, for he had been lying within a
few feet of his companion; but that he was
not the object of their regard could be readily
understood.</p>

<p>The man who had thus pinned the boy to
the earth by his heel wore moccasins rather
than boots, otherwise Isaac would have
received severe injury, and as it was, the corporal’s
recruit suffered considerable pain
before the foot was finally removed; but yet
made no sound.</p>

<p>So far as he could judge by the conversation,
these strangers must have been in camp
some time before he was awakened, for
when he first opened his eyes they were in
the midst of an unpleasant conversation with
the old soldier, such as had evidently been
carried on for some moments.</p>

<p>“If he don’t choose to tell, string him up
to a tree,” one of the party cried impatiently
<span id="pg_49" class="page_anchor">49 </span>
at the moment Isaac first became conscious
that matters were not running smoothly in
this private encampment. “A dead rebel is
of more good than a live one, and we have no
time to lose.”</p>

<p>“Hang me, if that’s what you’re hankerin’
for!” Corporal ’Lige cried in a voice that
sounded thick and choked as if a heavy pressure
was upon his throat. “Even though I
knew more concernin’ this ’ere expedition
than I do, not a word should I speak.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see whether you’re so willing
to dance on nothing,” the first speaker cried
vindictively, and then came noises as if the
man was making ready to carry his threat
into execution.</p>

<p>“Give him another chance,” one of the
Tories suggested. “Let the old fool tell us
all he knows of Allen’s plans, an’ we’ll leave
him none the worse for our coming.”</p>

<span id="pg_50" class="page_anchor">50 </span>

<p>“I know nothing!” the corporal cried in a
rage. “Do you reckon the colonel would
lay out his campaign before me?”</p>

<p>“It is said he did so before you left Pittsfield.”</p>

<p>“Whoever says that is a liar; but even
though he had made the fullest explanations,
I would not reveal the plans to you. You
must think I’m a mighty poor kind of a soldier
if I don’t know how to die rather than
play the traitor.”</p>

<p>“You’ll soon have a chance of proving
what you can do!” the third man cried
angrily, and then it was he stepped forward,
leaving Isaac free to do as he thought best.</p>

<p>That these three Tories were bent on hanging
the old soldier, or at least so nearly
doing so as to frighten him into disclosing all
he knew regarding Colonel Allen’s plans,
there could be no question, and young Rice,
<span id="pg_51" class="page_anchor">51 </span>
trembling with fear though he was, had no
other thought than as to how it might be
possible for him to aid his comrade.</p>

<p>It did not seem probable the men were
ignorant regarding the boy’s presence, and
the only explanation which can be made as
to why they failed to secure him is that he
was so nearly a child as to appear of but little
consequence. They evidently had no
thought that he could in any way thwart their
purpose, and, therefore, no heed was given
to him.</p>

<p>It can readily be imagined that Isaac did
not waste much time in speculations as to
why he was allowed to remain at liberty.</p>

<p>Now was come the moment when he might
repay some portion of the debt he believed
he owed Corporal ’Lige, and the only anxiety
in his mind was lest he should not do it in
proper military fashion.</p>

<span id="pg_52" class="page_anchor">52 </span>

<p>He could not even so much as guess what a
genuine soldier would do under the same
circumstances; but he had a very good idea
as to how a boy might extricate himself from
such a difficulty, and lost no time in beginning
the work.</p>

<p>The three men were so busily engaged trying
to frighten the corporal into telling them
what he might know of Colonel Allen’s
forces as not to heed the noise Isaac made
when he rolled himself toward the bushes
in that direction where the two muskets
had been set up against a tree under the
foliage in such manner that they might not
be affected by the dew.</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to say exactly
what these intruders were doing to Corporal
’Lige, but, from the noises, he judged they
had first made a prisoner of the old man by
seizing him around the throat, perhaps while
<span id="pg_53" class="page_anchor">53 </span>
he was yet asleep, and now there was every
indication that they were making ready to
carry out the threat of hanging.</p>

<p>“Give him another chance to tell what he
knows,” one of the men cried, and immediately
afterward the old soldier replied:</p>

<p>“String me up if you will, for there’s no
need of waiting any longer with the idea that
I’m goin’ to give you any information, even
if I have it.”</p>

<p>“Then up with him!” the man who had
first spoken shouted, and Isaac, without
looking in that direction, heard the confused
noises which told him the enemy were trying
to raise the old man to his feet.</p>

<p>By this time the boy had his hand on one
of the muskets, and his first impulse was to
discharge it full at the intruders; but before
he could act, the thought came that there
were two shots at his disposal, and he ought
<span id="pg_54" class="page_anchor">54 </span>
to so plan as to make both of them count.
He believed it was necessary to work with
the utmost speed, lest these three Tories
should have hung the corporal before he was
ready to interfere, and yet a certain number
of seconds were absolutely necessary before
he could carry out that plan which had suddenly
come into his mind.</p>

<p>With both muskets under his arm he crept
cautiously a few paces onward until screened
by the foliage, and then raising one of the
weapons, took deliberate aim at the nearest
enemy.</p>

<p>There was no thought in his mind that he
was thus compassing the death of a human
being. He only knew his comrade’s life was
in danger, and that a well-directed shot might
save him.</p>

<p>The three men had by this time gotten a
rope around Corporal ’Lige’s neck, and, finding
<span id="pg_55" class="page_anchor">55 </span>
that it was difficult to raise the old man
to his feet, were throwing the halter over the
limb of the nearest tree as a method of
saving labor.</p>

<p>One of the Tories, he who appeared to be
the elder, and who was directing the movements
of the others, stood a few paces from
his comrades, and, taking deliberate aim at
him, Isaac shouted:</p>

<p>“Throw down your weapons, and surrender,
or you are dead men!”</p>

<p>The words had but just been spoken when
he discharged the musket, and a scream of
pain from the living target told that the
bullet had sped true to its mark.</p>

<p>The two men who were as yet unarmed
dropped the rope they were holding and
sprang toward their weapons, which had
been left on the ground near by; but before
they could reach them, Isaac had emptied a
<span id="pg_56" class="page_anchor">56 </span>
second musket, and another cry of pain rang
out.</p>

<p>“Throw down your weapons and surrender,
or you are dead men!” he shouted again, and
at this the third Tory, who must have believed
there was more than one man in the
thicket, took to his heels in alarm, while
Corporal ’Lige, who had received no worse
injury than a severe choking, seized upon
the three muskets which were lying close
beside him.</p>

<p>Even now, when two of the intruders were
wounded and the third running for dear life,
Isaac was doubtful as to whether he should
show himself.</p>

<p>He remained in concealment, while the
corporal gazed around him in surprise for a
dozen seconds or more, and gave no token of
his whereabouts until the old man shouted:</p>

<p>“Hello, friends! Show yourselves!”</p>

<span id="pg_57" class="page_anchor">57 </span>

<p>“Is it all right?” Isaac asked timidly, and
in a tone which was little better than a
squeak. “Is it all right, corporal?”</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-2">
<a href="images/ill-02.jpg"><img src="images/ill-02-min.jpg" alt="Illustration"></a>
<p>“IS IT ALL RIGHT, CORPORAL?” ISAAC ASKED TIMIDLY.</p>
<p class="place"><em>Corporal ’Lige’s Recruit, p. 57.</em></p>
</div>

<p>“Come in here, Isaac Rice. Can it be it
was you who fired those shots?”</p>

<p>The raw recruit came forward almost
timidly, and Corporal ’Lige, shifting the
three muskets he had taken possession of
over on to his left arm, seized the boy by the
hand.</p>

<p>“I’ve done a good bit of soldierin’ in my
day, lad; seen surprises, an’ ambushes, an’
attacks of a similar kind without number;
but never did I know of anything that was
done with more neatness an’ dispatch than
this same job of yours, which has saved my
neck from bein’ stretched. I’m proud of
you, lad!”</p>

<p>Isaac was overwhelmed by this praise, yet
not to such an extent but that there was a
<span id="pg_58" class="page_anchor">58 </span>
great fear in his mind lest he had taken a
human life, and he asked anxiously:</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I hurt either of them
seriously, Corporal ’Lige?” and he pointed to
where the wounded men lay.</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped you killed ’em both, so
that we may be spared any further trouble
with the vermin,” and not until then did the
corporal condescend to give any attention to
those enemies who had been so sadly worsted
by a boy.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the wounded Tories
suffered more in mind than in body, for they
now understood who had made the attack
upon them, and it can readily be fancied that
both were ashamed at having been thus
defeated in their purpose by one whom they
had considered of so little importance that
no effort was made to deprive him of his
liberty when they surprised the encampment.</p>

<span id="pg_59" class="page_anchor">59 </span>

<p>It was with the most intense relief that
young Rice heard the corporal’s report,
which was to the effect that he who had
acted as leader of the party had a severe but
apparently not exceedingly dangerous wound
in the shoulder, while his comrade was
suffering from a bullet-hole in the leg.</p>

<p>“They’re disabled, lad, but not killed, an’
the first bit of soldierin’ that you have been
called on to do is like to give great credit
with such as Colonel Allen and Colonel Easton.
Tell me how you happened to think of
overcoming them in this shape?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of it,” the boy replied.
“It seemed to me you were like to be hanged
and I only did what was in my power.”</p>

<p>“I came nigher to havin’ my neck stretched
than ever before, an’ as it was, the villainous
Tories pulled mighty hard on that rope,
before you effected the rescue; but, lad, you
<span id="pg_60" class="page_anchor">60 </span>
must have thought! This attack you made
in such a soldierly fashion wasn’t the result
of chance, an’ that I’ll go bail.”</p>

<p>It was useless to make any attempt at convincing
Corporal ’Lige of what was only the
truth.</p>

<p>The old man was so determined to look
upon the rescue as a soldierly act that he
would not accept any other explanation, and
the boy ceased his fruitless efforts by asking:</p>

<p>“What is to be done with these two
Tories?”</p>

<p>“I reckon they must be got back to camp,
although it would be no more than servin’
’em right if we put an end to their miserable
lives without further parley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you wouldn’t kill them in cold blood,
Corporal ’Lige?” Isaac cried in alarm.</p>

<p>“No; I don’t reckon I would, though that’s
what ought to be done with ’em. It’s plain
<span id="pg_61" class="page_anchor">61 </span>
you an’ I can’t lug the two a matter of a mile
or more, so one must stand guard over ’em
while the other goes back to the camp. I’m
leavin’ it to you to say which service you’ll
perform, for after this night’s work I’m
willin’ to admit that my recruit has in him
the makin’s of a better soldier than I can
ever hope to be.”</p>

<p>The boy gave no heed to this praise at the
time, although later he remembered the
words with pleasure.</p>

<p>Now there was in his mind a fear lest the
corporal should desire him to guard the
prisoners, and, the more imminent danger
over, he was growing exceedingly timorous.</p>

<p>“I’ll go back to the encampment if it so
please you, Corporal ’Lige, because I can run
faster than you.”</p>

<p>“As you will, lad, as you will. Explain to
Colonel Ethan Allen what has happened here
<span id="pg_62" class="page_anchor">62 </span>
and let him say how these venomous snakes
are to be treated.”</p>

<p>During this conversation neither of the
wounded men had spoken; but now, as the
boy was about to set out for the encampment,
he who had evidently acted as the
leader cried sharply:</p>

<p>“Hold on a bit! What is the sense of
sending us into your camp when we are like
to die? Why not give us a show for our
lives?”</p>

<p>“In what way?” Corporal ’Lige asked
sternly.</p>

<p>“By allowing us to go to our homes.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” the old soldier said
angrily. “After your attempt to kill me I’m
not such a simple as to let you go scot free.
Get you gone, lad, and make the report to
Colonel Allen as soon as may be.”</p>

<p>The wounded Tory continued to plead with
<span id="pg_63" class="page_anchor">63 </span>
the corporal; but Isaac did not wait to hear
anything more.</p>

<p>He set out at full speed down the road in
the direction where the troops were encamped,
running at his best pace, and fearing
each instant lest that Tory who had made his
escape should suddenly come upon him.</p>

<span id="pg_64" class="page_anchor">64 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-4">CHAPTER IV.
<span class="title">THE LETTER.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">When</span> Isaac was come within hailing distance
of the few sentinels who had been
posted to guard against a surprise, he was
astonished at being halted after having
announced who he was, and the laxness of
military discipline can be understood when
it is said that, after being recognized by the
recruit at that particular post, the boy was
allowed to enter the encampment without
further question.</p>

<p>Colonel Allen was not better lodged than
his men. A lean-to formed of a few boughs
was the only shelter he had, and Isaac was
forced to search among the sleeping soldiers
<span id="pg_65" class="page_anchor">65 </span>
several moments before discovering the
whereabouts of the commander.</p>

<p>Once this had been done it was but the
work of a few seconds to acquaint the officer
with what had occurred, and at this evidence
that the Tories were dogging the little army,
more than one recruit who had boasted the
loudest as to what he would do when the
time for fighting should come, turned suspiciously
pale as he approached to hear all
Isaac was saying.</p>

<p>“Why did Corporal Watkins camp by himself?”
Colonel Allen asked when the boy
concluded his report.</p>

<p>“Because some of the men poke fun at
him, allowin’ that he’s too old to be of service,
an’ far too crochety to make any fist at
bein’ a soldier,” Isaac replied promptly.</p>

<p>“I wish from the bottom of my heart that
I had one hundred men like him, rather than
<span id="pg_66" class="page_anchor">66 </span>
some of the braggarts who do not know there
is such a work as the manual of arms,” the
colonel said in a loud voice, as if desirous
that all should hear. “Tell the corporal that
he will camp with this force in the future,
and I shall make it my especial business to
learn who it is that dares make matters
uncomfortable for him.”</p>

<p>Then, to the captain of the company to
which Corporal ’Lige was attached, an order
was given that a squad of men be sent forward
to bring in the prisoners, and when this
had been obeyed the old soldier, as a matter
of course, returned with them.</p>

<p>From that night Isaac heard nothing more
regarding the wounded Tories. It was said
they had been sent back to Pittsfield under a
strong guard, and certain it is they disappeared
from the encampment before daybreak,
but neither the boy nor the corporal
<span id="pg_67" class="page_anchor">67 </span>
could find a single man who had seen them
depart.</p>

<p>This incident, and it was hardly to be
spoken of as anything of importance, together
with Colonel Allen’s remark, served
to render Corporal ’Lige’s life more pleasant,
for those who had used him as the butt of
their mirth began to understand that he was
superior to themselves, in a soldierly way,
and more than one sought his advice on
various occasions.</p>

<p>At sunset on the seventh day of May the
raw recruits had arrived at Castleton, fourteen
miles east of Skenesborough, and Isaac
himself has given the details of that straggling
march through the country, in the first
letter written to his mother after setting out
as a soldier:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="date">
“May the Eighth, 1775.
</div>

<div class="salutation">
“My Dear Mother, Father, and Children:
</div>

<p>“We have been camping here in this
<span id="pg_68" class="page_anchor">68 </span>
thicket since last night, and if there is anybody
in all the company more tired of soldiering
than I am, I would like to meet him.
I wore a hole in the heel of my stocking on
the second day, and got such a blister
because of it that I’ve been obliged to go
barefoot ever since.</p>

<p>“We have had plenty to eat, for the folks
along the road were most kind; but it’s
sleeping that has been the worst on me,
though the corporal says I never can hope to
be a soldier till I’m able to lay down in three
or four inches of water and get as much rest
as I would at home in bed. I tell him I don’t
hope to be one any more, for I’ve had about
enough of it, though of course I shall stick
by the company till we’ve taken the fort,
and it’s pretty certain we shall do that,
because now there are two hundred and
seventy men in the ranks.</p>

<p>“Colonel Easton enlisted thirty-nine of his
militia before we got to Bennington, and
<span id="pg_69" class="page_anchor">69 </span>
there we were joined by the Green Mountain
Boys under the command of Colonel Ethan
Allen.</p>

<p>“It surprised me to find that a good many
of the people don’t believe we are doing right
in trying to take away the fort from the
king’s troops, and the corporal says that
unless this thing is a success we are all like
to be hanged for traitors, because his majesty
will make an example of them who are foremost
in the work—which means us.</p>

<p>“Two hours after we halted last night Colonel
Benedict Arnold, who is said to have
gone from New Haven as captain of a company,
to Cambridge, arrived here with a few
men and a large amount—so it seems to me—of
military supplies.</p>

<p>“Although knowing that Colonel Allen is
in charge of this force, he claimed the right
to take command, and, so the corporal says,
made display of a commission signed by the
Massachusetts Committee of Safety, declaring
<span id="pg_70" class="page_anchor">70 </span>
that it entitled him to take charge of all
the troops. Now, although I’m not a soldier—the
corporal says I never will be—I’ve got
sense enough to understand that if I enlisted
under Colonel Easton, and was willing he
should give way to Colonel Allen so we
might have the Green Mountain Boys with
us, the Massachusetts Committee of Safety
have got nothing to do with saying who shall
lead in the battle—though I hope to goodness
we shan’t see one.</p>

<p>“The corporal says that no committee is
going to scare Ethan Allen, and it’s certain,
so those of the Green Mountain Boys with
whom I’ve talked say, that this stranger
won’t get himself into command of the company,
even though, as is said, he brings one
hundred pounds in money, two hundred
pounds’ weight of gunpowder, the same of
leaden balls, and one thousand flints, to
carry all of which, and himself, he has ten
horses.</p>

<span id="pg_71" class="page_anchor">71 </span>

<p>“Now, the corporal claims that these
things, including the money, are munitions
of war, and that if Colonel Arnold doesn’t
deliver them over to Colonel Allen, they will
be taken from him, and he, Corporal ’Lige, I
mean, went early this morning to Master
Phelps, offering to see to it that this property
was delivered up to us; but for some reason
or other—neither the corporal nor I can
understand what—his offer was not accepted.</p>

<p>“I have heard it said, and the corporal is of
the opinion it is true, that when the council
of war was held last night before this gentleman
from New Haven arrived, Colonel Allen
was chosen commander of the whole expedition,
Colonel Easton second in command, and
Seth Warner third. It was decided that the
greater number of us, with the principal
officers, would march from here to Shoreham—which
you know is opposite Ticonderoga—and
Captain Herrick with thirty men would
at the same time go to Skenesborough to
<span id="pg_72" class="page_anchor">72 </span>
capture young Major Skene, whose father,
the governor, is now in England; seize all
the boats they can find, and join us at Shoreham.
Captain Douglas is to go to Panton
with a small troop, and get whatever craft is
in the water roundabout. The corporal says
he shall be quite well satisfied with this
arrangement, providing the remainder of the
plan is mapped out as he thinks right.</p>

<p>“However, nobody seems to know whether
Colonel Arnold will manage to get his commission
from the Massachusetts Committee
of Safety recognized as good and sufficient
authority for him to lord it over our people,
and we ask each other what will become of
his munitions of war in case he doesn’t, or
how may the plans be changed if he does?”</p>

<p>“What I can’t understand in this whole
business is why the corporal shouldn’t be
the third officer in command, instead of
Master Warner, who I have no doubt is a
very worthy gentleman; but of course cannot
<span id="pg_73" class="page_anchor">73 </span>
claim to be any such soldier as Corporal
’Lige. He says there’s always a lot of
jealousy among officers in the army, and
that’s why he isn’t to be given a chance to
show how much he can do.”</p>

<p>“The food I brought from home was used
up the second day—the corporal had what he
called a ‘coming appetite’—and perhaps it
was just as well, for I had all the load any
fellow could want to carry. I never believed
before leaving home that father’s musket was
so heavy; I held it over my shoulder until it
seemed as if the flesh was worn right down
to the bone; then lugged it in my hand till
my arm ached as if it was going to drop off,
and I verily believe I would have thrown
the thing away but that Corporal ’Lige said
a soldier didn’t amount to very much unless
he had a weapon of some kind.”</p>

<p>“The corporal says I am to give you his
dutiful compliments, and to say that if his
<span id="pg_74" class="page_anchor">74 </span>
life is spared, by the blessing of God, he will
capture Ticonderoga before we come back.</p>

<p>“As for me, I wish I was at home now,
though it will be a fine thing if we do what
the old man says is our duty in these times,
without being hanged.</p>

<p>“I haven’t yet found out why people think
there is so much honor to be gained in being a
soldier. To my mind it’s much like any
other way of running around the country;
but the corporal says if he had the management
of affairs things would be different,
because he’d keep the men right up to their
work, though I don’t see how it could well be
done. For my part, I shouldn’t carry a
musket over my shoulder when I was lame
and tired just because any man said so. It
would be as well whatever fashion I lugged it,
providing the labor was lessened; but the
corporal says it would make all the difference
in the world if we marched the same as we
would at a muster.</p>

<span id="pg_75" class="page_anchor">75 </span>

<p>“I love you all very much, and shall be
precious glad to find myself at home again.</p>

<p>“From your obedient and dutiful son,</p>

<div class="signature">
“Isaac Rice.”
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>In this letter the young recruit, who
although having enjoyed the teachings of
Corporal ’Lige, was certainly not a soldier at
heart, has told the main facts in the case
regarding the halt of the militia at Castleton;
but it will be observed that his modesty was
too great to permit of his mentioning the
brave part he played in the rescue of Corporal
’Lige from the Tories.</p>

<p>He has failed, however, most probably
through ignorance, in giving Colonel Arnold’s
authority for claiming his right to lead the
expedition.</p>

<p>That officer had brought to Cambridge
from New Haven a company of which he was
<span id="pg_76" class="page_anchor">76 </span>
the captain, and upon arriving there at once
reported to the Massachusetts Committee of
Safety that it would be possible, before the
forts had been reinforced, to seize the works
at Ticonderoga and Crown Point with a comparatively
small body of men.</p>

<p>He proceeded to organize an expedition for
such a purpose, and to this end was supplied
with the money and munitions of war mentioned
by Isaac, together with a colonel’s
commission, which gave him the chief command
of troops, not exceeding four hundred
in number, which he might raise to accompany
him against the lake fortresses.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Stockbridge, in the province
of Massachusetts, he learned that
another expedition had set out—that is to
say the same one Corporal ’Lige and Isaac
accompanied—and after engaging officers
and men to the number of fourteen he hastened
<span id="pg_77" class="page_anchor">77 </span>
onward, overtaking the militia as
Isaac has said.</p>

<p>In this camp where military discipline was
conspicuous by its absence, the recruits, who
had learned within the hour what had been
decided upon the night previous by the
council of war, soon ascertained the position
which the officer from New Haven claimed,
and knew exactly what he proposed to do by
virtue of his commission.</p>

<p>Even though the men had not learned such
facts from their officers, those recruits who
accompanied Colonel Arnold would have at
once made the matter public.</p>

<p>At about the time Isaac finished the letter
to his mother the encampment was in a state
bordering on insubordination.</p>

<p>Colonel Arnold’s recruits raised in Stockbridge
insisted that their leader should command
the forces, not only because he was
<span id="pg_78" class="page_anchor">78 </span>
authorized to do so, but owing to the fact
that he had the money and ammunition
necessary to carry out the plan, while the
members of Colonel Allen’s regiment, known
as the Green Mountain Boys were equally
determined that such honor as might be
gained should be their colonel’s, and in a
brief space of time these new-fledged patriots
were ripe for riot.</p>

<p>Now was come the hour when Corporal
’Lige had shown him some portion of that
consideration which he believed due his
experience in military affairs.</p>

<p>Those members of Colonel Easton’s militia
regiment which had joined the expedition,
jealous because their leader had
given way to Colonel Allen, now demanded
loudly and publicly that he must lead the
party or they would turn back.</p>

<p>Inasmuch, however, as this portion of the
<span id="pg_79" class="page_anchor">79 </span>
troops amounted to fifty or thereabouts, they
had a small showing when the Green Mountain
boys, who were more than two hundred
strong, came forth in turn with their threats.</p>

<p>Colonel Allen was to be retained first in
command, as had been decided upon the
previous evening, or they should march back
to Bennington without an hour’s delay.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the men from Stockbridge
insisted that Colonel Arnold was the
lawful commander because he was the only
one who held a commission for such purpose,
and threatened that neither money nor
munitions of war should be given up unless
his claims were fully recognized.</p>

<p>On this morning of the eighth of May the
men were divided into three divisions
according to their opinions, and it seemed
much as if the officers were willing they
should settle it without interference, for
<span id="pg_80" class="page_anchor">80 </span>
those highest in command remained in
council among themselves, giving no heed to
the threats which were uttered here and
there until it seemed positive personal encounters
must soon take the place of words.</p>

<p>The men from round about Pittsfield, recognizing
the need of a leader in what might
properly be termed a mutiny, selected Corporal
’Lige as if by common consent, and
Isaac had but just written his mother’s name
on the missive which had cost him so much
labor, when he and the corporal were surrounded
by the faction to which belonged
their neighbors and friends.</p>

<p>One of these, a butcher, whose home was
in Pittsfield, thus addressed the old man,
using at the beginning of his remark just
that compliment best calculated to please
him.</p>

<p>“You, who have had so much experience
<span id="pg_81" class="page_anchor">81 </span>
in military affairs, Corporal ’Lige, should be
able to settle this matter without any great
loss of time, for according to my way of
thinking it must be arranged among the men
themselves, or not at all.”</p>

<p>“I have seen plenty of fightin’,<ins title="Note: absent in the original">”</ins> the corporal
began slowly, as if undecided what words had
best be used; “but it was in the king’s army,
as you well know, and there every one in
command held their commission from his
majesty, which plainly said he was to be the
leader. Now it seems in this ’ere case that
the only officer who has any real authority is
the one from New Haven——”</p>

<p>A chorus of derisive howls interrupted the
old man, and not a few of his neighbors
accused him of being a traitor because he
was apparently on the point of giving his
decision in favor of the stranger.</p>

<p>Waiting patiently until they had exhausted
<span id="pg_82" class="page_anchor">82 </span>
their anger, and were silent once more, he
continued placidly:</p>

<p>“As I said before it seems to me the only
one with any show of authority is the officer
from New Haven; but,” and Corporal ’Lige
emphasized this word, “but what do you
know of this ’ere Massachusetts Committee
of Safety? Accordin’ to my way of figurin’,
that body of men are lookin’ out for matters
round about Boston, and we’ve got with us
recruits all the way from Pittsfield up to
Bennington, none of whom are given overmuch
to heedin’ what the Boston folks think
is right or wrong. Therefore I say, that while
the officer from New Haven seems to have
the only real authority, it strikes me that
his commission does not extend as far as
this ’ere spot, where we are encamped.”</p>

<p>Again he was interrupted; but this time by
cries expressive of satisfaction and good will.</p>

<span id="pg_83" class="page_anchor">83 </span>

<p>“We were the ones who started the idea of
taking the fort,” a recruit from Pittsfield
cried, “and that being the case I hold we’ve
got the right to say who shall lead us.”</p>

<p>“But the Green Mountain Boys won’t go
except their colonel is in command,”
another added, and a third cried:</p>

<p>“The men of Stockbridge will hold to Colonel
Arnold, and won’t go on under another.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve heard all that before,” Corporal
’Lige said in a tone of fine irony. “If
you have come to me to repeat the same
story that has been goin’ ’round the encampment
since daybreak, why then you are
wastin’ your time. If you want my opinion
so that this thing can be put right in short
order, hold your tongues, an’ I’ll give it.”</p>

<p>“Let Corporal ’Lige finish.”</p>

<p>“He is soldier enough to know what should
be done.”</p>

<span id="pg_84" class="page_anchor">84 </span>

<p>“Go on, corporal, go on.”</p>

<p>This evidence of popularity was most
pleasing to the old man, and smiling benignantly
upon those nearest, he said, with the
air of one who cannot be in the wrong:</p>

<p>“This is how it must be done: Let them
as come with Colonel Easton, stick to him;
the Green Mountain Boys shall hang to the
tail of Colonel Allen’s coat, and the Stockbridge
men may follow Colonel Arnold.
That makes three bands of us. Now, mark
you, lads, there are three sides to that ’ere
fort—one apiece. Let us meet here at whatever
hour you will, and then start on the
minute, each troop taking a different course,
an’ them who arrive first an’ capture the
fortification, gets the credit.”</p>

<p>“But we are needing what Colonel Arnold
brought with him,” someone cried.</p>

<p>“Ay, and you would have heard me fix that
<span id="pg_85" class="page_anchor">85 </span>
if you’d waited. Where did this ’ere Massachusetts
Committee of Safety get these
munitions of war an’ this money? Why,
they got it out of the province, of course.
And where did we come from? Why, we
come from the province of Massachusetts, of
course. Then who does this money and
these munitions of war belong to? Why,
they belong to us, of course. Now, as near
as I have heard, there are only fourteen
following Colonel Arnold. How long will it
take us to lay our hands on all that stuff?
Then I guarantee that Colonel Easton—for
if he wants me to do it I’ll help him in conducting
the campaign—will march straight
through an’ take Ticonderoga before you’ve
had time to say Jack Robinson. Never mind
what the Green-Mountain Boys do, an’ as for
the Stockbridge men, they ain’t enough for
the countin’.”</p>

<span id="pg_86" class="page_anchor">86 </span>

<p>The advice which Corporal ’Lige had given
met with the unqualified approval of all
whom he addressed, and instantly shouts
were raised in his honor until those recruits
who were not in the secret looked about them
in alarm and dismay as if fearing an attack.</p>

<p>Isaac was frightened, of that there could
be no mistake.</p>

<p>It seemed to him as if an immediate and
unquestionably dangerous encounter could
not be prevented, for already were the men
hanging about Corporal ’Lige in a dense
body as bees hang about their queen when
swarming, all urging that he lead them on to
wrest from the Stockbridge men the
property which he had proven did not belong
to them.</p>

<p>Isaac glanced this way and then as if trying
to determine in which direction it would
<span id="pg_87" class="page_anchor">87 </span>
be safest to flee, but at this moment his eyes
fell upon a lad of about his own age, who
had come in from the highway and was
staring about him in perplexity.</p>

<span id="pg_88" class="page_anchor">88 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-5">CHAPTER V.
<span class="title">NATHAN BEMAN.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">In</span> his fear and trouble it seemed to Isaac
as if this stranger might render him some
valuable assistance.</p>

<p>It was as if he stood alone amid the
recruits, now that Corporal ’Lige had been
claimed, so to speak, as leader of the Pittsfield
faction, and the lad needed some one to
whom he could appeal for advice.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that while the new-comer
was staring about him as if distracted by the
tumult, Isaac approached in the most friendly
manner as he asked:</p>

<p>“Are you a recruit?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Do you belong to the soldiers here?”</p>

<span id="pg_89" class="page_anchor">89 </span>

<p>“Do you call these soldiers?” the stranger
asked almost contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Well, if they ain’t, what do you call
them?”</p>

<p>“They look to me like a crowd of folks
what was goin’ to have a fight pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“That’s jest what I’m afraid of. Say, do
you live near here?”</p>

<p>“No, I came from Shoreham. We heard
there was a crowd comin’ to take Fort
Ticonderoga, an’ seein’s how they didn’t get
along very fast, I thought I’d come an’ hunt
’em up. Do you count yourself a soldier?”</p>

<p>“I did when I left Pittsfield; but I’ve
kind’er got over that feelin’ now. What’s
your name?”</p>

<p>“Nathan Beman.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s Isaac Rice.”</p>

<p>“What made you come out with a crowd
like this?”</p>

<span id="pg_90" class="page_anchor">90 </span>

<p>“All the folks ’round our way was enlisting,
and they said it was the duty of everybody
to fight against the king. Besides that
the corporal was going, an’ he agreed to put
me through in great shape.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the corporal?”</p>

<p>“That’s him over there with the red coat
on.”</p>

<p>“Do you allow an old chap like him could
put anybody through in very great shape?”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk like that about Corporal
’Lige where anybody will hear you. Why,
he’s a regular soldier; fought under General
Abercrombie in ’58, an’ I reckon if it hadn’t
been for him the king’s troops would have
got it terrible bad.”</p>

<p>“An’ that’s about the way they did get it.”</p>

<p>“Well, Corporal ’Lige is here now, an’ it’ll
be different. Did you ever see the fort?”</p>

<p>“See it? Why, I’m over there pretty near
<span id="pg_91" class="page_anchor">91 </span>
very week. Our folks sell eggs an’ chickens
an’ such truck to the garrison, an’ I know the
place jest like I do my own home.”</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose we can take it?”</p>

<p>“There seems to be a sight of you here;
but I shouldn’t want to make a guess till
after I’d seen whether there’s going to be a
row among all hands or not. Father says
when thieves fall out honest men get their
due.”</p>

<p>However frightened Isaac might be, he was
not disposed to allow any boy of his own size
to call the members of this army thieves,
even though they were in a state of insubordination,
and forgetting all his fears he
demanded sternly:</p>

<p>“Who are you calling thieves?”</p>

<p>“Now, you needn’t get so huffy, ’cause I
didn’t mean anything,” Nathan replied
quietly, and yet with no show of alarm;
<span id="pg_92" class="page_anchor">92 </span>
“but father is always sayin’ that, an’ I
s’pose it means—well I don’t know what,
except that all hands of you are fightin’ here,
an’ it looks like as if Captain Delaplace
would get the best of it.”</p>

<p>“Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“The commandant of the fort, of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, see here, Nathan, it begins to look
as though there was goin’ to be a row for a
fact, and I hoped you lived close by so I
could go to your house till it was over.”</p>

<p>“But you’re a soldier, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not much of one.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ve enlisted, a fight is right
where you belong,” and Nathan appeared to
think this settled the matter beyond any
argument.</p>

<p>“I ain’t so certain of that; but even if I do
belong in a fight I shan’t stay in one. It
seems like as if Corporal ’Lige had turned
<span id="pg_93" class="page_anchor">93 </span>
me off, an’ all he’s thinking about is helping
our crowd get the best of the Stockbridgers.”</p>

<p>“Well, there ain’t anything very dangerous
here yet awhile; suppose we wait an’ see
how things turn? I don’t care overmuch for
fightin’ myself; but that’s no reason why I
shouldn’t want to know whether there’s
likely to be a row or not.”</p>

<p>Isaac admired the courage of his new
acquaintance and immediately adopted him
as a protector, taking up his position a pace
or two in the rear of Nathan as he watched
the threatening movements.</p>

<p>The recruits from Pittsfield and vicinity
were standing in close order with the corporal
at their head, evidently ready for whatever
turn might come in affairs.</p>

<p>Some of them retained their weapons; but
the majority appeared to have more confidence
in their fists, and with arms bared to
<span id="pg_94" class="page_anchor">94 </span>
the elbow were awaiting the word which
would precipitate them upon the small body
from Stockbridge who guarded the treasure.</p>

<p>This last detachment had either learned of
the advice given by Corporal ’Lige, or scented
danger because they were so few in numbers
as compared with the other two factions,
and were standing shoulder to shoulder ready
to resist an expected attack.</p>

<p>A short distance away the Green-Mountain
Boys remained strictly by themselves; but
not giving any sign of taking part in the
lawless proceedings. So long as Ethan
Allen was considered the head of the expedition
they were satisfied to stand aloof from
any brawl.</p>

<p>As has been said before, the leading
officers were nowhere to be seen; some of
the better informed declared they were in
the shelter near by which had been used as
<span id="pg_95" class="page_anchor">95 </span>
their quarters during the night, and with
Colonel Arnold were discussing the question
of superiority in rank.</p>

<p>Corporal ’Lige hesitated to give the word
which should precipitate the riot.</p>

<p>He had been elevated to the position of
leader and perhaps the responsibility weighed
heavily upon him, for certain it is that after
advising what should be done, he evinced a
disposition to retire from what might be the
scene of a conflict.</p>

<p>“Look here, old man, we’re ready to do
as you have said. Now give the word and
lead us on to those recruits. We’ll soon find
out what they’re made of,” one of the men
said as the corporal turned toward the rear
much as though intending to join Isaac and
Nathan:</p>

<p>“Yes, give the word. This is your plan, and
we’re ready to carry it out as you have said!”</p>

<span id="pg_96" class="page_anchor">96 </span>

<p>“Fair an’ easy; fair an’ easy, comrades,”
Corporal ’Lige said soothingly. “A good
general doesn’t depend wholly on his plan
until he’s made certain of the enemy’s position.
You don’t allow that we can rush in
hilter-skilter an’ hope to work our purpose,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Why not? There are only a dozen of
them to near fifty of us.”</p>

<p>“But look at Colonel Allen’s regiment.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of them? They are not in
this quarrel, for their commander is leader of
the expedition so far.”</p>

<p>“No, they are not in it,” the corporal said;
“but what assurance have we they won’t
take a hand as soon as we begin operations?
Don’t you allow they know what the Stockbridge
men brought with them?”</p>

<p>“Why, everybody in camp knows that.”</p>

<p>“Then do you suppose they’re goin’ to
<span id="pg_97" class="page_anchor">97 </span>
stand by idly while we take the money and
munitions?”</p>

<p>The men began to murmur among themselves,
and Corporal ’Lige appeared well
satisfied that they should thus consume the
time; but before many minutes had passed
one and another spoke derisively of the old
man, asking what his plan was good for if he
didn’t dare carry it out, or why he had not
made mention of what Colonel Allen’s men
might do in event of his suggestion being
acted upon?</p>

<p>At first the corporal was not minded to
take heed of these disparaging remarks; but
as the clamor increased he was forced to
defend himself, and made answer sharply:</p>

<p>“The plan was good, and the only one
likely to succeed. When I got that far with
it you jumped to the idea that it should be
worked out at once. Now all the while I
<span id="pg_98" class="page_anchor">98 </span>
was keeping my eye fixed on Colonel Allen’s
men, tryin’ to make up my mind what
they’d do when we struck the first blow, and
I haven’t decided yet.”</p>

<p>“You’re a coward! You claimed to be an
old soldier, and to know more of warfare
than any one in this encampment, not excepting
the commanders, but yet you don’t dare
lead fifty men against a dozen!”</p>

<p>“If I don’t dare it isn’t because I’m afraid
of bodily injury; but I can’t afford to stake
my reputation as a soldier where the chances
are likely to be so heavy against us. It’s
one thing to have a good plan, an’ just as
important to know when to carry it out. If
we hang together an’ are ready to take
advantage of the first opportunity that
comes, then we’ll be showing our strength;
but not by rushing in hilter-skilter like a
crowd of boys primed for a rough-an’-tumble
fight.”</p>

<span id="pg_99" class="page_anchor">99 </span>

<p>Corporal ’Lige’s argument was evidently
considered a good one, for at once the outcries
which had been raised against him died
away, the men yet remaining in position as
if ready to act upon any suggestion he might
make.</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon there’s goin’ to be much
trouble ’round here after all,” Nathan said in
a tone of disappointment, and Isaac gave vent
to a sigh of relief. “It strikes me that old
man crawled out of a pretty small hole.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say he wouldn’t dare do
what the men wanted?”</p>

<p>“Well, he would be a pretty poor stick if
he didn’t. There’s four of this crowd to one
of that. What I allow is he’s afraid of the
officers, and if this is any kind of a military
company he’s got good cause to be, accordin’
to the way things run up to the fort. There
you wouldn’t hear privates tellin’ who
<span id="pg_100" class="page_anchor">100 </span>
should command ’em, an’ who shouldn’t, else
they’d find themselves in trouble.”</p>

<p>At this moment a great shout went up from
the Green-Mountain Boys, and as the two
factions who had stood facing each other
ready for the encounter glanced around
quickly, they saw Colonel Ethan Allen
approaching.</p>

<p>Then the Stockbridge men set up a shout,
for Colonel Arnold stepped to Allen’s side as
if of equal rank, and the Pittsfield detachment
remained silent, because Colonel Easton
was walking in the rear of these two
officers.</p>

<p>“It looks as if our colonel had given in, an’
wasn’t countin’ on standin’ up for his own
rights,” Corporal ’Lige said mournfully.
“Let one of you run over there an’ tell him
what we’re ready to do. Say we’ll begin the
scrimmage as soon as he gives the word.”</p>

<span id="pg_101" class="page_anchor">101 </span>

<p>This order was obeyed, and the little troop
watched the messenger as he approached the
colonel, and, without so much as touching
his cap by way of salute, spoke earnestly
during a few seconds.</p>

<p>Then Colonel Easton was seen to shake his
head decidedly, and the man returned to his
fellows looking thoroughly ashamed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Corporal ’Lige asked
sharply.</p>

<p>“He says if we had any idea of our duties
as soldiers we should be less ready to advise
and more eager to obey.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal of sense in that,” the
corporal said thoughtfully; “but at the same
time I claim matters are in such shape that
we’re justified in making the proposition.
When a body of men have got a commander
what won’t stand up for himself, it’s time
the rank and file took the matter in hand.”</p>

<span id="pg_102" class="page_anchor">102 </span>

<p>“Is that what you call good soldiering?”
Nathan Beman asked shrilly, and Isaac
clutched his new friend by the arm frantically
for it alarmed him that any one should dare
ask such a bold question of the corporal.</p>

<p>The old man turned around angrily; opened
his mouth as if to speak, and then, repenting
of his purpose, faced the on-coming officers
once more, much as if to say that such a
question from such a questioner was not
worthy of regard.</p>

<p>The group of officers advanced until they
were standing at equal distances from each
of the three factions, and Colonel Allen said,
speaking slowly and distinctly, looking at
the forces from Stockbridge and Pittsfield:</p>

<p>“It is no secret that you men are disgruntled
because I have been chosen commander
of the expedition. You are enlisted
as militia from the province of Massachusetts
<span id="pg_103" class="page_anchor">103 </span>
and as enroled men have no voice
in choosing a commander. Therefore I propose
to make no explanation of the matter;
but have taken this opportunity to address
you in order to say that, by the advice and
with the consent of the others in command,
those of you who cannot obey such orders
as may be given regardless of who is the
leader, had best return home from this point.
It shall not be counted against you as
deserters, for the names of those who are
unwilling to serve cheerfully will be stricken
quietly from the rolls, without any mention
whatever, dishonorable or otherwise. Colonel
Arnold presents himself with due
authority from the province of Massachusetts
to take command of any troops not
exceeding four hundred which may be raised
for the purpose of attacking Fort Ticonderoga.
Under all the circumstances he has
<span id="pg_104" class="page_anchor">104 </span>
decided to wave his claim of rank and act as
volunteer until the purpose for which we
have advanced be accomplished. Now, then,
those of you who cannot obey my orders,
step to the right.”</p>

<p>The Green-Mountain Boys began to raise
shouts of approval, but their colonel checked
them by saying sternly:</p>

<p>“Silence in the ranks! Let no man dare
give voice to his approval or disapproval of
what may occur in this encampment!”</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-3">
<a href="images/ill-03.jpg"><img src="images/ill-03-min.jpg" alt="Illustration"></a>
<p>“SILENCE IN THE RANKS!” THE COLONEL SAID STERNLY.</p>
<p class="place"><em>Corporal ’Lige’s Recruit, p. 104.</em></p>
</div>

<p>It was as if Colonel Easton believed some
of his men might take advantage of the
opportunity, and stepping quickly to the
side of Allen, he said:</p>

<p>“Lads, when the question came up last
night as to who should lead this expedition,
I cast the first vote for Colonel Allen. He is
a soldier of much experience and great
ability. It is my earnest desire that he take
<span id="pg_105" class="page_anchor">105 </span>
upon himself the responsibility of directing
our movements, and whatsoever he orders
shall be performed by me faithfully and
promptly.”</p>

<p>Colonel Arnold made no attempt to address
his men, and the three officers stood in
silence several moments, after which Allen
said:</p>

<p>“Because none of you have signified your
desire to be relieved from the enlistment,
we will suppose all are willing to go forward,
and from now out there can be no excuse
for insubordination or hesitation.”</p>

<p>This said, the officers withdrew once more,
and now that their colonel was no longer
there to check them the Green Mountain
Boys set up a shout of triumph, which was
answered by derisive yells from Corporal
’Lige’s troop, and apparent indifference by
the men from Stockbridge.</p>

<span id="pg_106" class="page_anchor">106 </span>

<p>“I reckon I may as well go home now,”
Nathan said in a low tone to Isaac. “There
don’t seem to be any chance of a row because
the men are going to give in easy
enough; but I’d like to see ’em find their
way into the fort. It ain’t so easy as they’re
countin’ on.”</p>

<p>“Who is this boy, Isaac?” Corporal ’Lige
asked as he stepped toward the lads, apparently
glad of an opportunity to disengage
himself from those who had shown they were
ready to obey his commands.</p>

<p>Isaac gave such explanation as was within
his power, and the old man asked, addressing
Nathan:</p>

<p>“What do you know about Fort Ticonderoga?”</p>

<p>The boy made reply much as he had to
Isaac, and the corporal questioned him
sharply:</p>

<span id="pg_107" class="page_anchor">107 </span>

<p>“Have you been allowed to roam over the
fortification at will?”</p>

<p>“There was no reason why I shouldn’t. I
know all the boys who live in the fort, an’
after I finished what I went for, who’d stop
us from goin’ ’round?”</p>

<p>“How many soldiers are there in the
place?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere about fifty, I should think.”</p>

<p>“Women and children?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’most twice as many, I reckon,
though I never counted ’em.”</p>

<p>“And you say you know all the ins and
outs of the fort?”</p>

<p>“Look here, how many times do you want
me to tell you? Of course I do; but what’s
that got to do with you?”</p>

<p>Nathan spoke in such a disrespectful tone
that Isaac literally trembled lest the corporal
should fall upon him in his wrath.</p>

<span id="pg_108" class="page_anchor">108 </span>

<p>“Wait you here till I come back, an’ see to
it that you don’t move from this spot.”</p>

<p>The corporal gave this command in his
sternest tones, and without waiting for a
reply hastened off in the direction where the
officers had disappeared, while Nathan stood
looking at his new acquaintance in mingled
surprise and bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Now, what does that old man mean when
he tells me to wait here? What right’s he
got to order me ’round?”</p>

<p>“Don’t get disgruntled,” Isaac said imploringly.
“I tell you he’s a great soldier,
and you’ll see that his order means something,
’cause the corporal don’t make foolish
talk.”</p>

<p>“Then, what was it I heard when I come
up here an’ he was tellin’ the men what to
do, but backed down after findin’ they were
ready to follow him?”</p>

<span id="pg_109" class="page_anchor">109 </span>

<p>“That part of it was all right. The time
hadn’t come for him to carry out his plans,
and he explained it. Couldn’t you hear
him?”</p>

<p>“I heard what he said; but that didn’t
deceive me.”</p>

<p>Then Isaac explained with many a detail
why the old man was the ablest soldier in
the encampment, and while he was trying to
convince the skeptical Nathan, Corporal
’Lige returned, looking very important and
mysterious.</p>

<p>“You’re to come with me,” he said tapping
Nathan on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Where?” the boy asked sharply.</p>

<p>“I said you were to come with me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may say it again before I go. I
want to know what you’re thinkin’ of doin’.
I ain’t one of these make-believe soldiers that
can be ordered ’round by such as you.”</p>

<span id="pg_110" class="page_anchor">110 </span>

<p>During an instant the corporal glowered at
the boy as if of a mind to chastise him for
his too familiar words, and then Isaac interposed
to save his new-found friend from
what he feared would be most severe punishment.</p>

<p>“He’ll go with you, Corporal ’Lige; don’t
be angry with him. You see he’s a stranger
here, an’ doesn’t understand what——”</p>

<p>“I understand enough not to go till I know
what he’s about,” Nathan cried angrily,
wrenching himself free from Isaac’s detaining
grasp and leaping back a few paces.</p>

<p>The corporal clapped his hand to his side
as if to raise a sword, and then realizing that
he had no such weapon, said in a remarkably
conciliatory tone:</p>

<p>“I told Colonel Allen that you were well
acquainted with the interior of the fort, and
he would speak with you a few moments.”</p>

<span id="pg_111" class="page_anchor">111 </span>

<p>“Well, if you’d said that in the first place
I would have been willing; but when you
jumped down on me as if I was one of these
recruits, I wasn’t goin’ to stand it.”</p>

<p>“If you are willin’ to come, follow me.”</p>

<p>“Am I to go with you?” Isaac asked
pleadingly, and the corporal hesitated an
instant before replying:</p>

<p>“Yes, lad, I don’t reckon it’ll do any
harm, and it may give you an insight into the
way we manage military affairs.”</p>

<span id="pg_112" class="page_anchor">112 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-6">CHAPTER VI.
<span class="title">A SQUAD OF FOUR.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Isaac</span> was in high glee at thus being permitted
to visit headquarters, for even though
he went there only by permission of Corporal
’Lige and not because his presence was
desired, it seemed to him that it was in a
certain degree a recognition of the possible
fact that he was really a soldier.</p>

<p>Nathan Beman, however, did not appear to
think there was any compliment in the invitation.
Naturally of a suspicious nature, he
fancied in some way this visit might work to
his harm, and, in addition, he was displeased
by the air of superiority which was observable
in the corporal when he addressed any
remark to the lad.</p>

<span id="pg_113" class="page_anchor">113 </span>

<p>The old soldier walked several paces in
advance of the boys, and did not appear to
think it necessary he should look around to
see if they were following, for in his mind a
request to visit headquarters was the same
as an imperative command, and one which
no sane person would venture to disobey.</p>

<p>“I suppose he thinks he can tow me
’round wherever he likes, and I’ve got a
mind to show him he can’t,” Nathan said to
Isaac, motioning with his thumb toward the
corporal.</p>

<p>“It’s Colonel Allen who wants to see
you,” Isaac ventured to suggest timidly.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Why Corporal ’Lige said so.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t certain that makes it true, ’cause
he’s said a good many things that don’t
amount to much since I’ve been around this
place.”</p>

<span id="pg_114" class="page_anchor">114 </span>

<p>“But the corporal wouldn’t lie,” Isaac said
solemnly, and Nathan added with a peculiar
smile:</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-4">
<a href="images/ill-04.jpg"><img src="images/ill-04-min.jpg" alt="Illustration"></a>
<p>“BUT THE CORPORAL WOULDN’T LIE,” ISAAC SAID SOLEMNLY.</p>
<p class="place"><em>Corporal ’Lige’s Recruit, p. 114.</em></p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, no, he wouldn’t lie!”</p>

<p>“See here, what have you got against the
corporal?”</p>

<p>“Me? Why should I have anything
against him?”</p>

<p>“That’s what puzzles me; but it seems as
though you didn’t think very much of him.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. I’ve seen soldiers up
’round Ticonderoga, not make-believes like
the old man, who is all talk an’ no substance.”</p>

<p>Isaac’s face flushed. He was not disposed
to let this stranger make sport of Corporal
’Lige, whom he knew was thoroughly versed
in the art of warfare, and a brave man
withal; but before he had decided in his own
mind how the most telling reproof could be
<span id="pg_115" class="page_anchor">115 </span>
administered, they arrived at headquarters,
which was neither more nor less than a shelter
built of pine boughs, situate so far from
the main encampment as to afford some
degree of seclusion.</p>

<p>Isaac judged from the eager look on the
faces of the officers that this visit was considered
by them of more importance than it
was by Nathan, and instantly Corporal ’Lige
saluted, Colonel Allen asked:</p>

<p>“Are both the lads acquainted with the
fort?”</p>

<p>“No, colonel; here is the one who lives up
Shoreham way,” and he touched Nathan on
the shoulder. “This,” he added, motioning
toward Isaac, “is a recruit I have taken
under my protection.”</p>

<p>It was evident that Colonel Allen came
nearer Nathan’s standard of a soldier than
Corporal ’Lige, for he stood in a respectful
<span id="pg_116" class="page_anchor">116 </span>
attitude before the officer as if recognizing
the latter’s right to question him.</p>

<p>“Is your father alive?” the colonel asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; he owns a farm up on the lake.”</p>

<p>“How often have you visited the fort
within the past year?”</p>

<p>“Mostly twice a week, sir; never less than
once.”</p>

<p>“Then you are sufficiently well acquainted
with the troops to be able to gain admission
at any time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; father sells a lot of truck there,
an’ I mostly carry it over.”</p>

<p>“Are you known to Captain Delaplace?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and his wife as well.”</p>

<p>“What brought you here, lad?”</p>

<p>“We heard it said there was a lot of soldiers
marchin’ up this way, and I didn’t have
much of anything to do, so come down to
have a look at ’em.”</p>

<span id="pg_117" class="page_anchor">117 </span>

<p>“Is it generally known near about where
you live that troops are marching toward the
fort?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, sir. Simon York, a
trapper, told father, and it was agreed
between them that nothing should be spoken
about it lest the news get out.”</p>

<p>“Do you know how many soldiers there
are in the fort now?”</p>

<p>“Near about fifty, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hark you, lad, are you minded to do a
service for those who would strike a blow
against the king?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that would depend on what it
was, an’ how much I’d make out of it,”
Nathan replied cautiously.</p>

<p>“Then you are not of the mind to do anything
toward establishing the independence
of the colonies—it is simply a question of
shillings and pence?”</p>

<span id="pg_118" class="page_anchor">118 </span>

<p>“Well, sir, perhaps it is something like
that,” Nathan replied, growing confused.
“Father thinks since the news came from
Concord and Lexington that all the provincials
ought to turn to and show their mettle;
but mother says so long as the king’s troops
buy truck and pay good prices for it, it is our
business to see that we don’t take the bread
and butter out of our own mouths.”</p>

<p>“I understand; yours is what might be
called a divided household,” and Colonel
Allen looked around with a smile at his
companions.</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t know what you mean by
that, sir; but things our way are about as I
have told you.”</p>

<p>Corporal ’Lige glowered at the boy who
thus unblushingly announced that he <ins title="Note: “measred” in the original">measured</ins>
his patriotism by its value in money, and
Isaac wondered that a lad so young could
<span id="pg_119" class="page_anchor">119 </span>
talk thus pertly to one as high in authority
as was Colonel Ethan Allen.</p>

<p>“If you should be paid six shillings, would
you be willing to guide one of these gentlemen
into the fort and come back with him to
where our troops might then be stationed?”</p>

<p>“Which one wants to go?” Nathan asked,
not intending to commit himself until the
full details were given.</p>

<p>“This gentleman,” and Colonel Allen
pointed toward Master Phelps, one of the
Committee from the Connecticut Assembly.</p>

<p>Nathan looked at him critically a moment,
and then asked, as if suspicious some portion
of the plan was being kept secret from him:</p>

<p>“Does he want to see Captain Delaplace?”</p>

<p>“He simply wishes to view the fort, and it
would be necessary you should pretend he
was a neighbor who had come with no other
motive than that of curiosity.”</p>

<span id="pg_120" class="page_anchor">120 </span>

<p>“You couldn’t pass him off for any neighbor
of our’n.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“’Cause he’s dressed too fine, an’ his face
is so pale that anybody’d know he didn’t live
’round here.”</p>

<p>“All that may be readily changed,” Master
Phelps interrupted. “I’ll promise to look so
nearly like one of your neighbors that there
shall be no question raised.”</p>

<p>“When do I get the six shillings?” Nathan
asked.</p>

<p>“After you have performed the work faithfully
to the extent of bringing Master Phelps
back to me,” Colonel Allen replied, now
speaking quite sharply. “It would be a
serious matter indeed if you were to betray
him to the commandant of the fort, or indicate
that this body of men are near at hand.”</p>

<p>“If I take the six shillings, I’ll earn ’em.
<span id="pg_121" class="page_anchor">121 </span>
It’s none of my business where you folks
are, nor what’s goin’ on ’round the fort; all
I’m looking after is the cash I can make.”</p>

<p>“Will you undertake the task?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Nathan replied, and then, as if a
sudden thought had come to him, added:</p>

<p>“I will if this boy goes along too.”</p>

<p>“Is he a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose so, ’cause I never saw him
before; but it’s goin’ to be mighty pokey all
alone with a man like him,” and Nathan
pointed to Master Phelps.</p>

<p>At this point Corporal ’Lige stepped forward
and saluted, thus attracting the colonel’s
attention, after which he motioned
toward the outside as if to ask for a private
interview.</p>

<p>The colonel immediately left the hut,
followed by the corporal, and Nathan looked
after them suspiciously, whispering to Isaac:</p>

<span id="pg_122" class="page_anchor">122 </span>

<p>“Now, what do you s’pose that old imitation
soldier is up to? He mustn’t try to get
the best of me.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid Corporal ’Lige will
do anything that’s wrong, ’cause he’s an
honest man, an’ no imitation of a soldier;
but a true one.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t so certain about all that; but you
seem to have a pretty good idea of him, so
perhaps he is half-way decent after all.”</p>

<p>At his point the old soldier and the colonel
returned, the latter saying when he was
inside the hut once more:</p>

<p>“In order that you may have no lack of
company I propose that Master Phelps,
Corporal Watkins, and the lad all go with
you.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Watkins?” Nathan whispered to
Isaac.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s Corporal ’Lige, of course.”</p>

<span id="pg_123" class="page_anchor">123 </span>

<p>“I knew he was stickin’ his nose into it
some way.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be glad to have him, ’cause he’s
jest as good as he can be after you get
acquainted.”</p>

<p>Nathan remained silent a few seconds, and
then asked abruptly:</p>

<p>“When does the crowd want to go?”</p>

<p>“At once. It should be possible to visit
the fort before sunset.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s accordin’ to how fast they
can walk; but if they start, an’ don’t get
there in time, father’ll keep them overnight
without chargin’ more’n what’s right for
the lodgings.”</p>

<p>“Very well; you may make ready to set
out immediately, and when you have
returned the money shall be paid you.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready now.”</p>

<p>“Master Phelps will need a few moments
<span id="pg_124" class="page_anchor">124 </span>
in which to prepare himself for the journey,
and I doubt not but that the corporal and his
comrade have some belongings which they
will want to take with them. Remain you
here, lad, until the others have made all
necessary preparations and are in condition
for the journey.”</p>

<p>This was a command which Nathan could
not well disobey; but he looked toward
Isaac while the latter was hurried away by
Corporal ’Lige, as if there were yet other
questions concerning this project which he
would like to ask.</p>

<p>“Don’t turn back, lad,” the old soldier said
when his <em>protégé</em> made a move as if to
return. “There’s to be no time lost, and
you’ll have good opportunity for talking
once we’re on the road.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen the colonel sent you
and me?” Isaac asked when the two were
<span id="pg_125" class="page_anchor">125 </span>
so far from headquarters that his words
could not be overheard.</p>

<p>“That’s owing to the hint I gave Colonel
Allen when that young skinflint made his
talk. A lad who won’t take sides in this
matter ’twixt the colonies and the king, but
holds out for whatever money he can get, is
not to be trusted, accordin’ to my way of
thinkin’. While he was settin’ himself down
for a cold-blooded, close-fisted specimen of
humanity such as you wouldn’t look for in
one so young, I made up my mind that there
had best be a sharp watch kept of him, else
a word or two might be dropped at the fort
which would upset all our plans.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe he would take Colonel
Allen’s money and then betray him?”</p>

<p>“I am certain a lad who would haggle for
six shillings under such circumstances as
this would sell out to the next man who
<span id="pg_126" class="page_anchor">126 </span>
offered half as much more, and the colonel
was of the same mind after I’d mentioned
the matter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I should go.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to?” the corporal asked
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Of course it would be more pleasant than
marching with the troops; but still I can’t
understand what good it is possible for me to
do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon you will be of any service;
but the boy had taken a notion to have you
with him, so it seemed like a good chance for
me to put my oar in, and between the two of
us I reckon he won’t have much show of
playing double.”</p>

<p>In a very few seconds the corporal and
Isaac had made their preparations for the
journey, which simply consisted in gathering
up all their belongings, much to the surprise
<span id="pg_127" class="page_anchor">127 </span>
of the lad, who questioned whether, if they
were to go to the fort apparently from
motives of curiosity, it was well they carried
muskets.</p>

<p>“If it seems necessary we can leave them
where this boy lives; but it is certain we
cannot depend on any one else bringing our
luggage along for us, so take what we own,
lad, an’ then be at home wherever we stop.”</p>

<p>When the two returned to headquarters
they found Master Phelps awaiting their
coming, and Nathan kept close and suspicious
watch upon each person and everything
within his range of vision.</p>

<p>The messenger from the General Assembly
had made a very decided change in his
personal appearance, and Isaac was forced
to look twice before feeling positive this was
the same Master Phelps whom he had seen
a few moments before.</p>

<span id="pg_128" class="page_anchor">128 </span>

<p>Now he was clad after the fashion of a
farmer, in garments which he had probably
borrowed from some member of the troop;
his face was browned and soiled, while his
hands were exceedingly dirty, and even
Nathan must have been satisfied that the
commandant of the fort would not see in
this visitor other than he professed to be.</p>

<p>“If that lad had a trifle more sense he’d
understand there wasn’t anything to be
gained by deceiving him,” the corporal said
in a low tone to Isaac; “but he’s so self-opinionated
he thinks everybody is plotting
mischief against him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to like him very well,”
Isaac ventured to say, and Corporal ’Lige
replied emphatically:</p>

<p>“Neither do I.”</p>

<p>“Then unless he an’ I go off by ourselves,
I don’t reckon this will be a very pleasant
<span id="pg_129" class="page_anchor">129 </span>
journey,” Isaac said to himself as he thought
of the corporal and Nathan, each distrusting
and making complaint against the other.</p>

<p>Colonel Allen was determined there should
be no delay in the setting out of this spying
expedition, and immediately the corporal and
Isaac showed themselves he insisted that the
little party start without further loss of time.</p>

<p>Young Beman at once showed his preference
as to a traveling companion, for he
ranged himself by Isaac’s side, and when the
corporal would have joined them, said curtly:</p>

<p>“You’d better keep back with the other
man. I s’pose I’ll have to lead the way,
and when we strike off the main road the
path ain’t wide enough for more than two.”</p>

<p>“Don’t the highway lead to Shoreham?”
the corporal asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Yes; but we can save more’n four miles
by cuttin’ through the woods,” and Nathan
<span id="pg_130" class="page_anchor">130 </span>
hurried Isaac on as a means both of putting
an end to the corporal’s inquiries, and forcing
him to join Master Phelps.</p>

<p>Once the journey was well begun young
Beman presented himself in a more favorable
light.</p>

<p>He ceased to refer to the corporal as an
“imitation soldier,” and gave no further
evidence of being suspicious; but <ins title="Note: “qestioned” in the original">questioned</ins>
Isaac as to what the town of Pittsfield was
like, and concerning Boston, where young
Rice had visited two years previous in company
with his father.</p>

<p>Master Phelps was not accustomed to this
method of traveling, and when the guide
struck into the woods where the trail lead
alternately over a hilly and swampy country
he was soon forced to declare that he could
not proceed at such a rapid pace.</p>

<p>“You will have to slacken up a bit,” Corporal
<span id="pg_131" class="page_anchor">131 </span>
’Lige shouted, “for the gentleman ain’t
used to this kind of footin’.”</p>

<p>“We can’t go very slow, else we shan’t get
to the fort before sunset,” Nathan replied
indifferently, and Master Phelps said in a
tone which admitted of no argument:</p>

<p>“It isn’t possible for me to keep pace with
you. If it so be we fail to finish the journey
before dark, we can take lodgings with your
father and accomplish our purpose early to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>The prospect of introducing to his father
guests who would pay for all they received,
was so satisfactory to young Beman that he
made no protest at being thus forced to
slacken pace. It may be he was unnecessarily
slow from this time out, for it was
already dark when they arrived at the guide’s
home, and Nathan said to Master Phelps
before entering the building:</p>

<span id="pg_132" class="page_anchor">132 </span>

<p>“I’ll tell father you folks want to stay all
night, and that’s as much as I need say. If
you count on explaining why you have come,
it’s none of my business. The officer what
hired me said I was to keep quiet about
everything I’d seen down to the camp, so I
might as well begin by holding my tongue.”</p>

<p>Then Nathan ushered the guests into the
kitchen, where was found Mr. Beman sitting
by the fireplace, for the night had grown
cold and chill, while his wife was preparing
the supper.</p>

<p>“Here are some travelers who want to stay
all night,” Nathan announced, and added in
a lower tone to Isaac, “Come out to the barn
with me while I do my chores; there’s no
fun in sittin’ here.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the three men followed
the boys, and Isaac fancied it was Master
Phelps’ intention to explain to the farmer the
<span id="pg_133" class="page_anchor">133 </span>
purpose of their coming, but that he feared
to do so in the presence of the mistress of
the household, who, if her son had quoted
her words correctly, favored the king’s
representatives rather than the colonists in
the doings which had lately arisen.</p>

<p>Nathan took good care that his new friend
should perform a full share of the evening’s
work, and Isaac assisted in milking the cows,
carrying water, and chopping wood until he
had of a surety earned as bountiful a spread
as could be set before him.</p>

<p>The farmer and his guests did not appear
until they had been summoned twice after
the appetizing meal was placed upon the
table, and while she was impatiently awaiting
them, Mrs. Beman questioned her son
sharply as to what business his father could
have with the strangers.</p>

<p>For a time Nathan avoided making any
<span id="pg_134" class="page_anchor">134 </span>
direct answer; but when his mother pressed
him closely he answered her quite as pertly
as he had Colonel Allen, by saying:</p>

<p>“I’m to be paid for holdin’ my tongue
about whatever is goin’ on—I’ll have six
shillings by this time to-morrow night, an’ I
can’t afford to talk to anybody.”</p>

<p>“Six shillings just for holding your tongue,
Nathan?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s for that an’ a little more; but I
ain’t goin’ to make any talk, so if you want
me to earn the money you’d better stop
askin’ questions.”</p>

<p>“Is your father going to get as much?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about his trades;
it’s all I can do to take care of my own, an’
work ’em through accordin’ to the agreement,
when there’s so much questionin’ goin’
on,” Nathan replied quite sharply, and his
mother, who was evidently as prudent as
<span id="pg_135" class="page_anchor">135 </span>
himself in financial matters, desisted from
pressing him further.</p>

<p>After this brief conversation Isaac felt
positive Corporal ’Lige need have no fear
regarding possible treachery on Nathan’s
part, for if the boy refused to tell his mother
he surely would be close-mouthed in the
presence of others.</p>

<p>When the party finally made their appearance
and were seated at the supper table, the
three men evidently on the best of terms
with each other, Mrs. Beman’s curiosity was
still further aroused, as was but natural.
Yet no word was dropped during the progress
of the meal, nor so long as the guests
remained downstairs, which could have given
her the slightest clew.</p>

<p>It was Nathan’s purpose to have Isaac for
a bed-fellow; but to this his mother made
emphatic protest, and when the time for
<span id="pg_136" class="page_anchor">136 </span>
retiring came the three guests were conducted
to a room adjoining the kitchen, while
the farmer’s family retired to the loft above.</p>

<p>Then it was in cautious whispers that Isaac
told the corporal why he felt confident there
was no danger Nathan would betray them,
and the old soldier said grimly:</p>

<p>“He didn’t have a fair test when he was
talking with his mother, ’cause there was no
chance she would pay him for the information.
What I’m afeared of is that some one
may offer him more than Colonel Allen did,
an’ then I’ll go bail everything he knows
will come out in short order.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he would do other than he
has agreed.”</p>

<p>“Well, lad, you hold to that opinion, an’
I’ll have my own, an’ ’twixt the two of us I
reckon he won’t be able to do any mischief.
His father is a proper kind of man; holds to
<span id="pg_137" class="page_anchor">137 </span>
it that the colonists are right in making war
against the king, and stands ready to do all
he can in furtherance of the cause. Therefore
if this young jack-a-napes holds himself
too high an’ mighty in the mornin’ we shan’t
be wholly in his power.”</p>

<p>When day dawned, however, Corporal ’Lige
had no reason to complain of Nathan.</p>

<p>The lad showed himself of the mind to earn
the six shillings, and now that he was at
home, appeared less suspicious of his companion’s
intentions.</p>

<p>Perhaps this was due in part to the fact
that his father, well knowing what the
visitors would have, took it upon himself to
give the guide positive instructions, and at
an early hour Nathan set out accompanied
by Master Phelps.</p>

<p>It was his intention that Isaac should be
one of the party; but to this the farmer made
<span id="pg_138" class="page_anchor">138 </span>
decided objections, insisting that more than
one stranger might cause suspicion, and
therefore it was that Corporal ’Lige and his
pupil remained quietly at the farm until noon
of that day, when the delegate from the Connecticut
Assembly returned well pleased
with what he had seen.</p>

<p>In a private conversation held with the
corporal he reported that strong though the
fortification was, the walls were in a state
of great dilapidation; few, if any, precautions
taken against surprise; military discipline
was hardly known, and the sentinels
in particular were remiss in their duty.</p>

<p>Master Phelps had no difficulty in making
such investigations as he chose, and declared
that in his opinion, providing the garrison
could be taken by surprise, there was nothing
to prevent a capture of the fort.</p>

<p>However, in order that all this might be
<span id="pg_139" class="page_anchor">139 </span>
effected, boats were necessary, and there
was not a sufficient number on the shores
near about to convey one-tenth of the men in
Colonel Allen’s command.</p>

<p>“It is well you have come with me,”
Master Phelps said to the corporal, “for while
I am returning, you and the lad, accompanied
by the farmer, shall set about seizing
all the boats which may be found in this
vicinity, having due heed to your movements,
however, lest you proceed so far in
the direction of Crown Point as to arouse
suspicions in that quarter. Work as expeditiously
as is in your power, for the troops
will arrive here not later than midnight, and
it is absolutely necessary there be ready
proper craft to convey them across the lake.”</p>

<p>Then Master Phelps, still holding to
Nathan as a guide, set off to meet the force,
which was believed to be rapidly approaching,
<span id="pg_140" class="page_anchor">140 </span>
and the farmer said impatiently to the
corporal:</p>

<p>“If it so be, sir, you count on carrying out
the orders given ’twixt now and dark, it is
time for us to be moving, for boats are not
plentiful hereabout, and we shall have a
long tramp before gathering as many as
will carry your force across.”</p>

<span id="pg_141" class="page_anchor">141 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-7">CHAPTER VII.
<span class="title">TICONDEROGA.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">It</span> was not necessary Farmer Beman should
urge Corporal ’Lige to make haste in this
matter which had been intrusted to him, for
the old soldier understood full well how
necessary it was that means of transportation
for the troops should be at hand when the
men arrived, and had good reason to believe
that such task as was assigned him could
not be readily performed.</p>

<p>He even showed himself more eager in the
work than the farmer, for when the latter
would have delayed in order to eat the noonday
meal, the old man positively refused as
he said:</p>

<p>“We can have dinner after Ticonderoga has
<span id="pg_142" class="page_anchor">142 </span>
been taken, but until then there must be no
thought of rest. Although as I understand,
detachments are to be sent to Skenesborough
and Panton, it is not positive they can get
boats from there to this point in time, and
we must act as if believing the matter of
transportation depended wholly upon ourselves.”</p>

<p>Had Nathan been there to witness the old
man’s activity after some special work had
been set for him, he might have changed his
opinion about the corporal’s being an “imitation
soldier.”</p>

<p>He walked here and there, tiring his companions
almost to the verge of exhaustion,
and yet apparently as fresh as when he
began; but when the sun set he had only
seventeen boats drawn up on the shore at
that point where it was supposed the troops
would halt, and Isaac believed there were
<span id="pg_143" class="page_anchor">143 </span>
absolutely no more within the radius of a
dozen miles.</p>

<p>“I allow you’ve done your best, corporal,”
Farmer Beman said as the three stood looking
ruefully at the small number of boats,
many of which would be loaded to the
water’s edge with half a dozen men, “and it
now stands us in hand to get supper, considerin’
we missed our dinner so completely.”</p>

<p>“There must be no time wasted. Let
Isaac run up to the house for such provisions
as your wife can spare, and we’ll set out in
some other direction, for every craft that we
add to this ’ere lot is jest so much gained.”</p>

<p>“You may set out in as many directions as
you choose; but you will not find another
boat this night,” Farmer Beman said
decidedly, and with what was very like a
show of ill-temper. “I’ve guided you to
<span id="pg_144" class="page_anchor">144 </span>
every place I know of, and if you are so
headstrong as to keep on when there’s little
show of accomplishing anything, you must
go alone.”</p>

<p>“And that’s exactly what I shall do,” the
corporal said emphatically. “Even though I
knew nothing would be accomplished I
should keep on workin’ until the force
arrived, ’cause it isn’t for me to set down
and say my task is finished.”</p>

<p>“If that’s your idea of soldierin’, then I’m
mighty glad I haven’t enlisted,” and the
farmer went deliberately to his home, convinced,
as was his son, that the old corporal
was not as well skilled in warfare as he
would have it appear.</p>

<p>Even Isaac was disposed to protest against
his teacher’s decision, and urged that it was
little less than folly to think of adding to the
fleet, for Farmer Beman had declared positively
<span id="pg_145" class="page_anchor">145 </span>
there were no more boats in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>To this the corporal replied with some
warmth, and there might have been a
serious undermining of friendship had not
Nathan arrived just at that moment.</p>

<p>“Well, is that all you’ve done this afternoon?”
he asked sharply, and the corporal
turned on him fiercely.</p>

<p>“Do you know of other boats?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me there’s more’n a hundred
’round here.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>Nathan began a list, mentioning this
neighbor or that, and as often seeing among
the collection the craft to which he referred,
until finally he was forced to admit that to
the best of his knowledge there were no more.</p>

<p>“I thought you knew of more than a hundred?”
Corporal ’Lige cried fiercely.</p>

<span id="pg_146" class="page_anchor">146 </span>

<p>“That’s what I reckoned myself; but when
I come to figger ’em up they wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>“You come with us, an’ it may be we’ll
find another.”</p>

<p>“What? After I’ve walked down to
Castleton an’ back to-day, I go with you out
rowin’? It’ll take more’n six shillings to
hire me to do anything like that this night;
besides you haven’t got time before the
troops get here.”</p>

<p>“How near are they?” Corporal ’Lige
asked in alarm.</p>

<p>“Well, they ought’er be showin’ up by
this time, for I wasn’t five minutes ahead of
’em, and—there they are now!”</p>

<p>Nathan pointed to a group of men who had
just come into the clearing from amid the
thicket, and as the old man looked up one of
the party motioned for him to approach.</p>

<p>Although Nathan had announced that he
<span id="pg_147" class="page_anchor">147 </span>
was nearly exhausted from his ardent labors,
his weariness was not so great as his
curiosity, and he followed the corporal and
Isaac.</p>

<p>It was Colonel Arnold, Colonel Easton and
the two representatives of the Connecticut
Assembly, who had thus come into view, and
the former, after explaining to Corporal
’Lige that the troops had been halted in the
thicket lest they might be seen from the fort
even in the gloom, asked concerning the
means of transportation.</p>

<p>Chagrined though he was at his inability to
do more, the corporal was forced to admit
that he had hardly a sufficient number of
boats to take over seventy-five or eighty of
the men; but this the colonel did not at the
time believe to be of great importance, for it
seemed positive Captain Herrick from
Skenesborough, and Captain Douglas from
<span id="pg_148" class="page_anchor">148 </span>
Panton, must before midnight send craft
enough to transfer the entire force.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that the leaders of the
party appeared well satisfied, and the corporal
must have come to the conclusion that
he had fretted himself without reasonable
cause.</p>

<p>“You will remain in charge of the fleet,”
Colonel Allen said to the old soldier, “with
the boy to act as your lieutenant, and you
may detail two men as oarsmen in each
boat. We will set out as soon as the
remainder of the craft arrives.”</p>

<p>Then it was that Nathan believed he saw
an opportunity to add to his earnings of the
day, and made the proposition that if the
further sum of four shillings be paid him he
would aid in ferrying the troops across, providing
the work could be finished before
midnight; but if it should be delayed until
<span id="pg_149" class="page_anchor">149 </span>
morning he desired to be paid twice that
amount.</p>

<p>No one seemed disposed to take advantage
of this very generous offer; now that his
particular portion of the work had been done,
it was very much as if every one save Isaac
ignored him.</p>

<p>“That’s jest the way with these people from
down ’round Bennington. They get all they
can for the least money, an’ then throw you
off. I ought to have held out for more’n six
shillings when I took that Master Phelps, as
you call him, over to the fort.”</p>

<p>“But you got paid very well,” Isaac
suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, so far as it went; but if I’d thought
of all that’s going on I would have put up
my price, or held out half-hired till the
business was over.”</p>

<p>Now for the first time since their meeting
<span id="pg_150" class="page_anchor">150 </span>
did Corporal ’Lige’s pupil speak sharply to
this friend.</p>

<p>“You should be ashamed to demand money
for such work as you have done this day,”
he said stoutly. “Whatever resistance be
made to the king is for the benefit of all the
colonies, and if each one insisted on being
paid, as you’ve done, his majesty might
work his will, for there would be none to say
him nay.”</p>

<p>Young Beman was both surprised and
injured by this outburst.</p>

<p>“That’s what I call pretty tough, after all
I’ve done for you!” he cried sharply. “If it
hadn’t been for me you wouldn’t have got
over here and had a chance of staying all
night in our house.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have a chance without paying for
it, as I understand Master Phelps is to settle
with your father for our accommodations.”</p>

<span id="pg_151" class="page_anchor">151 </span>

<p>“Yes, an’ just before I come away mother
told me she thought as likely as not father’d
be such a fool as to refuse to take a cent;
but I ain’t goin’ to quarrel with you, even if
I have been defrauded of what is my right.
Come up to the house an’ get some supper,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>“You mean that I shall partake of the food
after I have helped you do the chores?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, something like that. Of course
you don’t expect to get your supper for
nothing.”</p>

<p>“No; I’d rather go without than do more
work now after tramping around all the afternoon.
There’ll be something in the way of
rations found in camp, an’ I’ll take my
chances there.”</p>

<p>Young Beman turned away quickly as if
angry with this new friend, and observing
the movement Corporal ’Lige asked Isaac:</p>

<span id="pg_152" class="page_anchor">152 </span>

<p>“What’s the trouble with yon skinflint?
Haven’t been quarrelin’, eh?”</p>

<p>“I think I have seen enough of a lad who
must be paid for all he does at such a time,”
and having said this Isaac went in search of
his supper, not minded to make further
explanations.</p>

<p>Weary though he was, the lad was soon
forced to aid the corporal in getting the
boats’ crews together, and after it was fully
dark those selected to act as oarsmen were
marched to the water’s edge, that they might
be in readiness when their services were
required.</p>

<p>After this there was nothing to be done
save await the coming of the expected craft.</p>

<p>The men were not allowed to build fires
lest the lights should be seen by those in the
fort, and so cautious was the leader that
even loud talking was forbidden, therefore
<span id="pg_153" class="page_anchor">153 </span>
the men could do little else than spend the
time in sleeping, a fact by no means disagreeable
to the majority after their march
of the day.</p>

<p>On the shore of the lake the oarsmen
followed the example of their comrades in
the woods, until all save the corporal and
Isaac were wrapped in the unconsciousness
of slumber.</p>

<p>The old soldier, considering himself responsible
for the safety of the fleet, would
neither lie down nor allow his young lieutenant
to do so, and they paced to and fro on
the sand keeping sharp lookout for the
expected boats, but without avail.</p>

<p>Midnight came, and yet no word from
either of the two detachments which had
been sent in search of means of transportation.</p>

<p>Colonel Allen and Colonel Arnold, growing
<span id="pg_154" class="page_anchor">154 </span>
impatient because of the long delay, came to
the shore, and Corporal ’Lige stood stiff as
the barrel of his own musket when he
saluted.</p>

<p>“How many can be taken in the boats you
have here?” Colonel Arnold asked.</p>

<p>“Somewhere about eighty, sir, and if it so
be you give the word we can ferry the whole
party across in three trips.”</p>

<p>“That would never do,” Colonel Arnold
replied decidedly. “We must go in a body
or give up all hope of surprising the garrison.”</p>

<p>In this Colonel Allen was agreed, and the
two officers remained near at hand, now
pacing to and fro, and again listening intently
for those sounds which would tell of the
hoped-for arrival, until it lacked no more
than two hours of daybreak, when they were
joined by Master Phelps and Colonel Easton,
<span id="pg_155" class="page_anchor">155 </span>
the latter saying sufficiently loud for Isaac to
distinguish the words:</p>

<p>“Unless such a move is made as may be
possible with the means at our disposal, the
plan of capturing the fort has come to naught,
for it isn’t reasonable to suppose our party can
remain in this vicinity throughout to-morrow
without some intimation being given the
commandant by those who live in the
vicinity.”</p>

<p>What was evidently a conversation between
the officers followed; but it was conducted
in so low a tone that Isaac could not
hear the words, and he remained near at
hand expecting to receive the order to launch
the boats, until Colonel Easton called him by
name.</p>

<p>“You know where is situated the home of
the lad who guided Master Phelps into the
fort?”</p>

<span id="pg_156" class="page_anchor">156 </span>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir; it is but a short distance
from here.”</p>

<p>“Go you there, and bring the boy.”</p>

<p>“I question if he will come, sir, unless I
make explanation of why he is wanted, or
promise that he shall be paid for thus disturbing
himself. He seems to have no
thought save of money.”</p>

<p>“Yet, his father is with us in this matter,
I am told, so far as opinion goes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then go and rouse the lad; if he refuses
to come, say to the father that Colonel Allen
requires the services of the boy, and if he
answers not what we make as a request,
I will send a detachment to enforce a
demand.”</p>

<p>Isaac obeyed promptly, not finding it a
simple matter to make his way across the
field in the darkness; but finally succeeding
<span id="pg_157" class="page_anchor">157 </span>
after one or two tumbles, each of which left
their marks in the shape of a scratch or contusion,
and with the first knock at the door
he heard Farmer Beman’s voice asking as to
who was there.</p>

<p>“It is Isaac Rice, sir, and Colonel Easton
has sent me to say that Colonel Allen desires
the attendance of Nathan at once.”</p>

<p>“What does he want him for?” the shrill
voice of Mrs. Beman cried, and Isaac replied
truthfully that he did not know, since no
explanation had been made him.</p>

<p>Then could be heard the farmer, his wife,
and son in what was evidently an altercation,
until no less than five minutes had passed, at
the end of which time young Nathan appeared
in the doorway fully clad, as he asked
impatiently:</p>

<p>“How much are they willing to give me for
coming out in the night like this?”</p>

<span id="pg_158" class="page_anchor">158 </span>

<p>“I think it would be well if you depended
upon their generosity, otherwise it is in
Colonel Allen’s power to force you to do as
he asks,” Isaac replied curtly, and from the
inside Farmer Beman shouted:</p>

<p>“Get you gone, boy, and do their bidding.
If I again hear you demanding money for
such services, your jacket shall be tanned
with the stoutest hickory switch I can get
hereabouts.”</p>

<p>One would have said young Beman was the
most abused lad in the province of New
York, as he followed Isaac down to the shore,
alternately bewailing his ill-fortune because
he had not given Captain Delaplace information
of the coming of such a body of men,
trusting to that officer’s generosity for a
greater sum of money than was given him by
Colonel Allen, and vehemently protesting he
would not stir one step from the encampment
<span id="pg_159" class="page_anchor">159 </span>
without being well paid for his services.
Colonel Easton, overhearing this threat,
stepped directly in front of the grumbling lad
and called for Corporal ’Lige, much to the
surprise of both the boys, saying when the
old soldier arrived:</p>

<p>“Corporal, it is Colonel Allen’s wish that
this lad remain near him after we have
landed on the other side, to show the way
into the fort. He is not disposed to do so
willingly, it seems, and it shall be your duty
to see that the order be obeyed. If he
attempts to escape, shoot him down; but give
him gentle treatment so long as he complies
with your requests.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of him, sir, that you may
depend on,” the corporal said grimly, and
from that instant Nathan Beman remained
silent regarding his desire to be paid for
acting the part of guide.</p>

<span id="pg_160" class="page_anchor">160 </span>

<p>Because of having received this order the
corporal was forced to relinquish his position
as commodore of the fleet, and thus it was
that he and his pupil were among the few
who entered Ticonderoga early that morning.</p>

<p>Within five minutes after Nathan had
apparently been subdued, word was passed
for as many of the Green Mountain Boys as
could be conveyed in the boats to embark at
once, and almost at the same moment Colonel
Easton, turning to the old man, said:</p>

<p>“It is your duty, Corporal ’Lige, to take
passage in the same craft that carries our
leader, for the lad of whom you have charge
must be kept where Colonel Allen can speak
to him at an instant’s notice.”</p>

<p>Had the men been allowed to follow their
inclinations, the frail boats which formed the
fleet would have been swamped even before
they pushed off from the shore, for every
<span id="pg_161" class="page_anchor">161 </span>
member of the troop was eager to be with
the first division, and it was only after considerable
difficulty in the way of restraining
the men that the different craft were
properly and safely loaded.</p>

<p>When the corporal and the lad who was
thus virtually held prisoner entered the boat
where was Colonel Allen, Isaac followed as
if it was his right so to do.</p>

<p>He could not fancy any position of affairs
where he would be debarred from remaining
with the man who had taken him “under his
wing,” and it so chanced that in the excitement
of embarking he passed aboard unheeded
by who might have checked him.</p>

<p>The darkness of night was just giving way
to the gray light of dawn when the little fleet
put off from the shore, and without being
really aware he did so, Isaac counted the
number of those who were thus afloat.</p>

<span id="pg_162" class="page_anchor">162 </span>

<p>Beside the officers, there were eighty-three,
including himself and Nathan, and it
was no longer reasonable to expect that
those who had been sent to Skenesborough
and Panton would arrive in time to be of
assistance.</p>

<p>“Will they try to take the fort with so
few?” he asked in a whisper of Corporal
’Lige, and the latter added emphatically:</p>

<p>“If all that is told of Colonel Allen be true,
he wouldn’t hesitate to make an attempt
single-handed.”</p>

<p>“But surely we cannot hope to do much,
for fifty men behind a fort should be a much
larger force than ours.”</p>

<p>“Savin’ and exceptin’ these men be surprised,
as our leader counts them in Fort
Ticonderoga will be,” the corporal replied,
and then placed his finger on his lips that the
lad should cease talking, for the order had
<span id="pg_163" class="page_anchor">163 </span>
been passed from boat to boat just before the
fleet left the shore that no conversation be
indulged in.</p>

<p>Nathan, sulky because of having been put
in charge of the man whom he disliked, gave
no apparent attention to anything.</p>

<p>In almost perfect silence the journey by
water was made, and brought to an end just
as the day was breaking, when, in obedience
to signals rather than words, the men disembarked
and were formed in three ranks close
to the water’s <ins title="Note: “ege” in the original">edge</ins>.</p>

<p>Then it was that Colonel Allen advanced
to where the men might hear when he spoke
in the tone of ordinary conversation, and
said with a calmness which in itself was
impressive:</p>

<p>“There are but few of us here to undertake
the work which was cut out; but yet
each of you should be a match for any two
<span id="pg_164" class="page_anchor">164 </span>
whom we may meet. Should we delay until
all the force can be ferried across, there will
be no longer opportunity to surprise the
garrison; therefore we must act for our comrades
as well as ourselves, remembering that
should we falter we cast shame on them also.
Now, lads, it is my purpose to march into
the fort, and I only ask that you follow
where I lead.”</p>

<p>The officers stepped forward quickly to
make certain there should be no cheering,
and wheeling about with true military precision
Colonel Allen started forward, Colonel
Arnold by his side, and Corporal ’Lige with
Nathan and Isaac directly in the rear.</p>

<p>Behind them came eighty of the Green
Mountain Boys.</p>

<p>There was no command given.</p>

<p>Each of the men copied the movements of
the leader, and noiselessly but rapidly they
<span id="pg_165" class="page_anchor">165 </span>
made their way up the heights toward the
sallyport, Isaac’s face paling as he went,
for he believed of a surety now was come
the time when he should hear the clash of
arms and find himself in the midst of combatants,
each striving to take the other’s
life.</p>

<p>On passing an angle at the rear of the fortification
the entrance of a trench or covert-way
was come upon and here they surprised
a sentinel half asleep, leaning against the
earthwork.</p>

<p>Awakened thus suddenly, and seeing what
he might naturally suppose to be the advance
guard of a large force directly upon him, he
took hasty aim at Colonel Allen and pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Isaac closed his eyes, believing
their leader must be killed at such short
range, but the weapon hung fire and the
<span id="pg_166" class="page_anchor">166 </span>
sentinel took to his heels through this trench,
the attacking party following at full speed.</p>

<p>The fugitive led the way to the parade-ground
within the barracks, where was found
another sentinel, and he made a thrust with
his bayonet at Colonel Easton, who was side
by side with the leaders; but had hardly
raised his weapon before a blow from the flat
of Colonel Allen’s sword sent him headlong
to the ground.</p>

<p>At this the men, unable longer to control
themselves, gave vent to a tremendous shout,
and without orders separated into two
divisions, each bent on gaining possession of
the barrack ranges.</p>

<p>As bees swarm out of their hives, so did
<ins title="Note: “he” in the original">the</ins> startled redcoats rush from the buildings,
and it seemed to Isaac as if instantly each
man appeared he was disarmed by one of the
Green Mountain Boys, who, as fast as he
<span id="pg_167" class="page_anchor">167 </span>
secured a captive, marched him to the center
of the parade-ground in order that he might
not block up the entrance of the barracks.</p>

<p>Now was come the moment when Nathan’s
services were required.</p>

<p>It was no longer possible to keep silence,
for the shouts of the men must have aroused
every one within the inclosure, and turning
quickly, Colonel Allen cried in a loud
voice:</p>

<p>“Get you before me with that lad, corporal
and let him lead the way to the commandant’s
quarters.”</p>

<p>Nathan did not require urging.</p>

<p>He understood that this man had come
with serious purpose, and knew full well it
might be dangerous for him to hang back.</p>

<p>Darting ahead as swiftly as the corporal
would allow, he conducted Colonel Allen to
the door of Captain Delaplace’s dwelling,
<span id="pg_168" class="page_anchor">168 </span>
and the leader gave three resounding knocks
with the hilt of his sword, as he shouted:</p>

<p>“Surrender this fort, commandant! Surrender
at once in order to save the lives of
your men!”</p>

<p>The door was quickly opened in response
to this demand, and a half-clad man, over
whose shoulder could be seen the frightened
face of a woman, appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>Before he could speak Colonel Allen cried:</p>

<p>“I order you instantly to surrender, sir!”</p>

<p>“By whose authority do you make such
demand?” the captain cried with dignity.</p>

<p>“In the name of the Great Jehovah and the
Continental Congress!”</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-5">
<a href="images/ill-05.jpg"><img src="images/ill-05-min.jpg" alt="Illustration"></a>
<p>BEFORE HE COULD SPEAK, COLONEL ALLEN CRIED: “I ORDER YOU INSTANTLY
TO SURRENDER. IN THE NAME OF THE GREAT JEHOVAH AND THE
CONTINENTAL CONGRESS.”</p>
<p class="place"><em>Corporal ’Lige’s Recruit, p. 168.</em></p>
</div>

<p>These words sounded in Isaac’s ears like
the thunder of cannon, and even while he
questioned to himself if it were possible this
handful of men had really captured the fortress,
Ticonderoga was surrendered.</p>

<span id="pg_169" class="page_anchor">169 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-8">CHAPTER VIII.
<span class="title">AN INTERRUPTION.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Nathan</span>, who had looked upon the men
under Colonel Allen much as he had Corporal
’Lige, was literally amazed by this
ready submission of the king’s troops, standing
silent and motionless by the side of Isaac
as the garrison was paraded without arms,
and the surrender made in due form.</p>

<p>Some days afterward Isaac learned that
the spoils of war at this place were one hundred
and twenty iron cannon, fifty swivels,
two ten-inch mortars, one howitzer, one
cohorn, ten tons musket-balls, three cartloads
flints, thirty gun-carriages, a quantity
of shells, a large amount of material for boat
building, one hundred stand of small arms,
<span id="pg_170" class="page_anchor">170 </span>
ten casks of powder, two brass cannon, thirty
barrels of flour and eighteen barrels of pork.</p>

<p>Forty-eight soldiers were surrendered and
preparations were at once begun to send
these, together with the women and children,
to Hartford.</p>

<p>Hardly was the surrender made complete
when such of the troops as had been left on
the opposite shore under Seth Warner, arrived
in a schooner, much to the surprise of
all, until it was learned that Captain Herrick,
who had been sent to Skenesborough to seize
the son of the governor, had succeeded in his
mission without bloodshed.</p>

<p>He took not only the young major, but
twelve negroes and attendants, seized the
schooner owned by the elder Skene, and had
come down the lake in the early morning
with the hope of aiding in the capture of
Ticonderoga.</p>

<span id="pg_171" class="page_anchor">171 </span>

<p>Isaac had supposed this victory would end
the adventure, and was saying to himself
that his experience had been rather pleasing
than otherwise, so much so in fact that he
almost regretted the time was near at hand
for him to return home, when he saw, much
to his surprise, a portion of the troops being
formed in line as if to leave Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>Corporal ’Lige had been assigned to the
task of overhauling the goods in the warehouse
for the purpose of making out a list of
the same, and it was to him that Isaac,
followed by Nathan, went for information.</p>

<p>“Forming in line, eh?” the old man asked
as, wiping the perspiration from his face, he
went outside to have a look around, and
instantly he noted the preparations which
were making, turned back to his work as if
it was of but little concern.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of that, corporal?”
<span id="pg_172" class="page_anchor">172 </span>
Isaac suggested. “Are we going back without
having stayed here a single day?”</p>

<p>“There will be no turnin’ back, lad, until
the work is finished, and the fort at Crown
Point yet remains to be taken. I allow Seth
Warner is goin’ to tackle that job, which
won’t be a difficult one, since it is said
there are not above a dozen men in the
garrison.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you an’ I go with ’em?” Nathan
suggested, now no longer eager to demand
money for his services; but, fired by what
he had seen, and burning to participate in
new conquests.</p>

<p>“What do you say, corporal?” Isaac asked,
feeling that it was necessary to gain the old
man’s permission before he could join in the
adventure.</p>

<p>Again Corporal ’Lige went to the door of
the warehouse, looking about him with the
<span id="pg_173" class="page_anchor">173 </span>
air of a weather-prophet, after which he
replied in a careless tone:</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon it makes any difference
whether you lads are here or sailin’ ’round
the lake, therefore if Seth Warner gives his
permission, you may go so far as I am concerned;
but it’ll be only a question of
whifflin’ from one point to another, for while
the wind holds in this direction I’m allowin’
none of the force will reach Crown Point.”</p>

<p>“The wind is likely to haul ’round after
sunset, so let us take our chances,” Nathan
whispered, and Isaac was not loth to embark.</p>

<p>Therefore the two started across the
parade-ground for the purpose of speaking
with the old hunter—Seth Warner—when
Captain Herrick, who had just made his
report of the night’s work at Skenesborough,
halted the boys by saying:</p>

<p>“I reckon you two lads are the ones Colonel
<span id="pg_174" class="page_anchor">174 </span>
Allen would speak with at once? You
will find him in the commandant’s quarters.”</p>

<p>“He is most likely thinkin’ of payin’ me
for comin’ over last night,” Nathan said as
the two turned to obey the command, “and I
have made up my mind not to take money
for the service.”</p>

<p>Isaac looked at his companion in surprise,
and the latter added almost shame-facedly:</p>

<p>“I reckon father was right when he said
every one in the colonies should do all he
could in this cause, and, besides, it looks to
me as if the king’s troops would speedily get
the worst of it.”</p>

<p>Young Beman was not unlike many in the
neighborhood who in after-days were royalists
or patriots as the cause of freedom grew
weak or strong.</p>

<p>However, Nathan had no opportunity to
refuse a payment of money for his services,
<span id="pg_175" class="page_anchor">175 </span>
for when the lads stood before Colonel Allen,
the latter said in a tone of command, and yet
with the air of one asking a favor:</p>

<p>“I want to send a messenger to Sudbury.
Do you think you can find the place, Isaac
Rice?”</p>

<p>“I will show him the way, sir,” Nathan
said promptly, and the colonel favored him
with a glance of surprise, but took no further
heed of his sudden complaisance.</p>

<p>“At that settlement you will find one
Captain Remember Baker; tell him what has
been done at this point, and say it is my
wish he join me here without delay. Select
the lightest boat you can find for crossing
the lake, and make all haste.”</p>

<p>Then the colonel turned away, intent upon
the work of preparing a list of the garrison
which had surrendered, and some of his
officers entering for further instructions prevented
<span id="pg_176" class="page_anchor">176 </span>
the boys from making any inquiries
concerning the mission.</p>

<p>On leaving the quarters, Nathan, eager to
serve this new commander of the fort with
all possible celerity, would have hastened at
once to the shore in order to set out, but that
Isaac insisted upon giving Corporal ’Lige due
information as to their proposed movements,
much to the displeasure of young Beman,
who claimed that the old soldier was of no
account when the colonel had given orders.</p>

<p>“Well, this one is,” Isaac said stoutly.
“He’s a good friend of mine, and I wouldn’t
think of leavin’ without first tellin’ him, no
matter whose orders I was obeying.”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose you must have your own
way, but the time will come when you won’t
think so much of that pig-headed old man as
you do now.”</p>

<p>To this ill-natured remark the lad did not
<span id="pg_177" class="page_anchor">177 </span>
reply, but on presenting himself to Corporal
’Lige and explaining what he was about to
do, the latter, still busy with his work of
taking account of the stores, made very
much the same remark as had Nathan.</p>

<p>“Don’t consider, lad, that you are to report
to me when ordered on duty. Be careful of
yourself; do not run into danger needlessly,
and get you gone without delay, for Colonel
Allen is a man who doesn’t take kindly to
loiterers.”</p>

<p>Nathan showed himself to be one who
could perform a task promptly and in good
order when it suited his pleasure so
to do.</p>

<p>He it was who selected the boat in which
they were to cross the lake; borrowed a
musket from one of the men that he might
not be forced to make the journey weaponless,
and succeeding in begging such an
<span id="pg_178" class="page_anchor">178 </span>
amount of provisions as would serve them
for dinner.</p>

<p>While these few preparations were being
made, Warner, with a detachment of twenty
five men from Colonel Allen’s regiment, put
off on his journey to Crown Point, and after
watching them a moment Nathan Beman said
in a tone of one who is satisfied with himself:</p>

<p>“It’s jest as well we didn’t have a chance
to go with that crowd, for they won’t get
anywhere near there until the wind changes,
and it seems as though whoever is in charge
of the job, ought to know it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the plan is to take the fort by
surprise, as was this one, and unless our
people get there soon, it will be a failure,
because the news of what has been done here
must fly over the country quickly.”</p>

<p>“While the wind blows this way, and so
strong, no one will get up the lake, therefore
<span id="pg_179" class="page_anchor">179 </span>
the garrison won’t learn of the surrender of
Ticonderoga unless some one goes across the
country. However, we needn’t bother,
seein’s our work is all cut an’ dried, and we
had better not waste too much time here.”</p>

<p>Isaac was beginning to entertain a very
friendly feeling toward this lad now that he
had changed his views so entirely regarding
the value of his services, and, as a matter of
course, Nathan could be a most pleasing
traveling companion when it suited his purpose,
as it did at present.</p>

<p>The journey to Sudbury proved to be a
longer one than was anticipated.</p>

<p>A strong wind which blew directly down
the lake, carried the boys fully two miles
below the point at which they should have
landed, and Nathan was much averse to following
back along the shore in order to gain
the trail which led to Sudbury.</p>

<span id="pg_180" class="page_anchor">180 </span>

<p>“It will be just that much useless labor,”
he said emphatically, “and I am not given to
walking more than may be necessary.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a chance of going astray if we
strike across from here,” Isaac suggested, for,
as has already been shown, he knew little of
woodcraft, and this traveling blindly around
a section of the country where there was
every reason to believe enemies might be
found was not to his liking.</p>

<p>“I’d be a mighty poor sort of a guide if I
couldn’t go across from here without straying
from the course so much as a dozen yards,”
Master Beman said decidedly. “To walk up
the shore two miles or more only for the
purpose of striking the trail, is foolishness.”</p>

<p>“But the thicket is so dense here,” Isaac
suggested timidly, almost fearing to venture
an opinion lest he should provoke the
mirth of his companion. “It will be harder
<span id="pg_181" class="page_anchor">181 </span>
to make our way through than to go
around.”</p>

<p>Nathan made no reply.</p>

<p>He bestowed upon Corporal ’Lige’s recruit
a glance as of pity, and then, without further
words, plunged into the underbrush.</p>

<p>Master Rice could do no less than follow.</p>

<p>Before the boys had traveled half an hour
on the direct course to Sudbury, it is more
than probable young Beman repented of
having attempted to make a “short cut,” for
the advance was indeed difficult.</p>

<p>At times it was really painful to force
one’s way through the tangled foliage, while
now and again the boys found themselves
floundering over swampy land; but Nathan
made no complaint because he was responsible
for having taken such a course, and
Isaac hardly dared protest lest his companion
should be angered.</p>

<span id="pg_182" class="page_anchor">182 </span>

<p>“I still maintain that it was better to come
this way than travel two miles in vain,”
Nathan said as he threw himself upon the
ground, and Corporal ’Lige’s recruit ventured
to suggest mildly:</p>

<p>“I’d rather walk three miles on the shore
than one here, where a fellow is obliged to
fight his way through.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you know this country better
than I do, and would take the lead?”</p>

<p>“Not so. You left Ticonderoga as guide,
and it would not be seemly in me, who am a
stranger here as well as a lad unaccustomed
to this sort of warfare which is now being
conducted, to do other than follow your lead;
but——”</p>

<p>The remark which was intended to soothe
the irritation in the guide’s breast was not
concluded, for Isaac was interrupted by the
sudden and unexpected appearance of three
<span id="pg_183" class="page_anchor">183 </span>
men, who came upon the boys as if from an
ambush.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” Master Beman cried carelessly as
if something in the way of a salutation was
expected from him.</p>

<p>Instead of replying to this hail the two
lads were seized roughly, and without a word
the strangers, taking possession of the musket,
began searching the messengers’ clothing
as if expecting something of value or
importance would be found.</p>

<p>“Look here! What are you about?”
Nathan cried angrily, while Isaac submitted
in silence, for he understood that these three
might be enemies to the cause. “What
do you mean by handling me in this
shape?”</p>

<p>“Better keep your tongue between your
teeth, young Beman,” one of the men said in
a surly tone. “When we ask for information
<span id="pg_184" class="page_anchor">184 </span>
there’ll be time enough for you to wag it so
freely.”</p>

<p>Surprised at having been thus recognized,
and heedless of the warning, Nathan continued:</p>

<p>“Who are you? I never saw you before!
What right have you to handle me in this
fashion?”</p>

<p>“The right of any of his majesty’s subjects,
for in these times it is well to overhaul every
rebel one runs across.”</p>

<p>“I’m no rebel!” Nathan cried, now exhibiting
signs of alarm.</p>

<p>“Your father is, which amounts to the
same thing,” the man replied, as, after having
satisfied himself the lad had nothing
concealed about his person, he rose to his
feet. “Why are you abroad to-day?”</p>

<p>“How long since is it that a lad may not
move about as he wishes?”</p>

<span id="pg_185" class="page_anchor">185 </span>

<p>“Since rebellion first showed its head in
these colonies. Now, answer my question,
or it will be the worse for you!”</p>

<p>Isaac, thoroughly alarmed, had made no
resistance either by word or movement when
the stranger searched him, and although
ignorant, as he had often said, of warfare,
he understood now full well that they were
fallen into the hands of enemies, who would
not hesitate at the taking of human life in
order to compass their ends.</p>

<p>Therefore he remained stretched upon the
ground as when the men first came upon
them, so terrified that it was almost impossible
either to move or speak.</p>

<p>Young Beman was frightened, but not to
such an extent as to prevent him from displaying
anger, and instead of replying to the
question he attempted to rise to his feet.</p>

<p>A blow delivered with unnecessary force
<span id="pg_186" class="page_anchor">186 </span>
sent him headlong to the ground again, and
his captor said warningly:</p>

<p>“Have a care what you are about, Nathan
Beman, for we are not disposed either to
bandy words or waste much time on such as
you, who, having professed friendship for
those in the fort, was ready to betray them.”</p>

<p>Now, Nathan’s fears were as great as
Isaac’s; but he made one more effort at
asserting himself, and began by telling a
lie.</p>

<p>“What have I done at the fort? I am but
just come from my father’s house.”</p>

<p>“Take that for the falsehood, and this for
believing us to be fools, who can be deceived
by such as you,” the man replied as he
viciously kicked the boy twice. “You have
but just come from Ticonderoga, and must
have been sent by the rebels who captured
the fort.”</p>

<span id="pg_187" class="page_anchor">187 </span>

<p>“What reason have you for saying that?”
Nathan asked in a more subdued tone.</p>

<p>“First, the fact of your being here, and
secondly because your comrade spoke, while
we were within hearing, of your having been
sent from Ticonderoga.”</p>

<p>Nathan shot an angry glance toward Isaac
as if Corporal ’Lige’s recruit alone was to
blame for this unpleasant interruption to the
journey; but he ventured no reply lest
further chastisement might follow.</p>

<p>“Tell me to whom you are sent, and have
a care in the replying, for we are not minded
to waste much time upon such as you.”</p>

<p>Nathan was beginning to understand that
he was wholly in the power of an enemy,
whom he could not readily deceive, and also
believed that it might be painful for him if
the answer was delayed.</p>

<p>He was not so devoted to the cause as to
<span id="pg_188" class="page_anchor">188 </span>
be willing to suffer in its behalf, and, therefore,
said surlily:</p>

<p>“We were going to Captain Remember
Baker at Sudbury.”</p>

<p>“Who sent you?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Allen.”</p>

<p>“Where is the message you are carrying?”</p>

<p>“He gave us none save by word of mouth.”</p>

<p>“Repeat it, and be careful lest you make
the mistake of telling another lie.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing in it of importance or
interest to you. It was simply that Captain
Baker should come at once to Ticonderoga.”</p>

<p>“Then the fort was taken last night?”</p>

<p>“I thought you knew that?” Nathan cried
in surprise, now understanding that he had
divulged what it was most important should
have been kept a profound secret until Crown
Point had been captured.</p>

<p>“We heard that the rebels were marching
<span id="pg_189" class="page_anchor">189 </span>
toward the fort; but could not get there in
time to warn the commandant.”</p>

<p>“Why was it you made prisoners of two
boys if you were not knowing to all that has
taken place?” Nathan asked, his curiosity
getting the better of his fears.</p>

<p>“We took the chance that you could give
us the desired information, because it was
not reasonable old Beman’s son should be in
this section unless on business of his father’s,
and in these times one can well guess what
that business might be. Therefore, having
heard you floundering through the thicket,
we drew near to listen to such conversation
as you might indulge in.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to waste time explaining
our purpose to that young cub, Jason Wentworth?”
one of the men asked impatiently,
and he who had been addressed replied with
a laugh:</p>

<span id="pg_190" class="page_anchor">190 </span>

<p>“We are not in as much haste now as we
were half an hour ago, Ezra Jones. Captain
Baker will not get the message, and while
the wind holds in this quarter I’m allowing
the rebels won’t reach Crown Point before
we do.”</p>

<p>“They will if we loiter here all day. Truss
up the lads, so they can do no mischief, and
let us be off.”</p>

<p>“Would you leave them here in the thicket,
Ezra Jones?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“They might starve to death, and while
I’m willing to serve the king in all things, it
is not my intent to be thus barbarous.”</p>

<p>“They can make themselves heard if any
one passes by on the trail,” the third man
replied very carelessly, and Ezra added
quickly:</p>

<p>“Ay! I had not thought of that. They
<span id="pg_191" class="page_anchor">191 </span>
must be gagged, or, what may be better for
us, shot offhand.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to kill two boys in cold
blood, Ezra Jones?”</p>

<p>There was no reply to this question, and
Jason Wentworth turned round to the other
man.</p>

<p>“Matthew White, will you take it upon
yourself to do what is little less than
murder?”</p>

<p>“No; carry them further into the thicket,
where they cannot be heard from the trail,
and there tie them up.”</p>

<p>“It were better we shot them at once, than
leave them to starve,” Jason Wentworth said
much as if speaking to himself, and during
this conversation the feelings of the two lads
can be faintly imagined.</p>

<p>The question of their death by bullet or
starvation was being discussed in such a
<span id="pg_192" class="page_anchor">192 </span>
business-like manner, as if there was no
alternative, that the boys were literally
paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p>It seemed to Isaac Rice as if the three men
remained silent fully five minutes before
Jason Wentworth spoke again, and then it
was with the air of one who has decided
some vexed question.</p>

<p>“I’m not willing to play the part of a
savage,” he said, speaking slowly in order to
give his words due weight. “Neither do I
propose that they shall carry the message.
We’ll take them with us.”</p>

<p>“And thus we shall be caused much
delay,” Ezra Jones muttered.</p>

<p>“If they are wise we will travel as rapidly
as when alone, and in case of a refusal to
obey orders they can be shot, or left to
starve, as easily half an hour hence as now.
Besides, there will be much work at the oars
<span id="pg_193" class="page_anchor">193 </span>
’twixt here and Crown Point, and they can
do a little more than their share of it.”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this last suggestion which
caused the other two men to agree to the
proposition.</p>

<p>At all events, no further objection was
made, and Master Wentworth took it upon
himself to direct the march of the prisoners.</p>

<p>“You are to keep half a dozen paces in
advance, and take good care there is no
loitering, or any attempt at giving us the
slip,” he said to the boys, who yet lay upon
the ground. “I do not propose that you shall
be starved to death; but at the same time I
would put a musket-ball into one or both of
you without compunction, rather than suffer
delay or escape. Now get on your feet, and
move lively, for only by obedience can you
save your lives.”</p>

<p>There was no disposition on the part of
<span id="pg_194" class="page_anchor">194 </span>
Colonel Allen’s messengers to run counter to
the command which had been given.</p>

<p>Each knew full well that two of their three
captors were in favor of leaving them to a
most cruel death, which could be escaped
only by prompt acquiescence to all the
orders given.</p>

<p>Therefore it was they leaped to their feet
quickly, and set forward at a sharp pace,
when Jason Wentworth pointed out the
direction to be pursued.</p>

<p>At this moment it was Isaac who suffered
most in mind, for he knew full well that
Corporal ’Lige would condemn him for not
having the courage to face death rather than
give information to the enemy.</p>

<p>Even though it was Nathan who had
divulged what should have been kept a secret,
the raw recruit knew in his own heart
he had agreed that the information should be
<span id="pg_195" class="page_anchor">195 </span>
given, because of having made no protest.</p>

<p>If Seth Warner failed in his purpose, it
would be owing in a certain degree to what
had been told these men, and Isaac, who had
hoped to win renown, if not glory, by enlisting,
could charge himself with what was
worse than a blunder.</p>

<p>On the other hand Nathan was not sore in
mind because of the possibility that Crown
Point might still be held by the king’s
troops; but he had sufficient sense to understand
that if he had retraced his steps along
the shore to the trail, as Isaac proposed, this
capture might not have been made.</p>

<p>Therefore, but in a different fashion, was
his mental trouble as great as that of his
comrade.</p>

<p>To the chagrin of both the boys they came
upon the trail leading from the lake to
<span id="pg_196" class="page_anchor">196 </span>
Sudbury, after not more than two or three
minutes’ traveling, and thus knew that if
their halt had been delayed a very short
time it might have been possible to have
given these enemies the slip.</p>

<p>Once on the trail word was given to halt,
and the three men held a brief consultation
as to the course they should pursue.</p>

<p>One was in favor of going directly to the
shore, where it appeared they believed a boat
could be found; but the others insisted on
keeping within the thicket until they were
arrived a mile or more above the fort, lest,
being seen, pursuit should be made by those
who had captured Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>This last proposition prevailed, although
there were many chances they might not find
a boat further up the lake; but Jason Wentworth
persisted it would be better if they
make the journey entirely on foot, than take
<span id="pg_197" class="page_anchor">197 </span>
the risk of being captured before word could
be carried to Crown Point.</p>

<p>On being commanded to push forward once
more the boys obeyed readily, if not willingly,
and during the hour which elapsed
before they gained the desired point, Nathan
and Isaac had ample opportunity for conversation,
since their captors did not seem
to be averse to their talking one with the
other.</p>

<p>“Of course, we shall be held prisoners by
the king’s troops once we are arrived at
Crown Point,” Isaac ventured to say after
they had traveled steadily, although slowly,
onward for nearly half an hour, and young
Beman replied in a petulant tone:</p>

<p>“That goes without saying, and it shows
what a fool I’ve been in running around with
those who would oppose the king’s will. If
father is eager to ruin himself, that’s no
<span id="pg_198" class="page_anchor">198 </span>
reason I should be a fool, and I’d better have
listened to mother.”</p>

<p>“Why speak of what has been done?”
Corporal ’Lige’s recruit asked in what he
intended should be a soothing tone. “I am
not acquainted with the country as you are,
neither am I so brave; but yet it seems as if
we should be on the alert for a chance to
escape.”</p>

<p>“Now you talk like a fool! How may we
escape with these three men on watch, all of
whom are willing to shoot us at the first
chance we give them. I’m not minded to
have a bullet put through my body; but
would rather trust to the king’s troops, in
the hope that after a time we may be set
free.”</p>

<p>“Yet if we could give these men the slip?”</p>

<p>“You may be certain we shan’t have a
chance.”</p>

<span id="pg_199" class="page_anchor">199 </span>

<p>“Yet, suppose we did?”</p>

<p>“Why will you be so weak-headed, Isaac
Rice? If this is really war between the king
and the colonies, the lives of boys like us
count for but little, especially since two of
these men are eager to be rid of us.”</p>

<p>Isaac understood that it was useless just at
this time to make any attempt at arousing
his companion from the petulant despondency
into which he had fallen, wherefore
wisely kept silent; but at the same time was
firmly resolved to be on the lookout for any
opportunity of gaining his freedom.</p>

<p>His timorousness had fled before the
thought that there might yet be a chance, he
knew not how, of preventing the information
of the fall of Ticonderoga from being carried
to Crown Point.</p>

<p>The boy had in his heart just then what is
commonly called courage, and his will was
<span id="pg_200" class="page_anchor">200 </span>
good, at whatever cost to himself, to repair
the mischief which had been done.</p>

<p>He had hoped to animate his companion to
the same pitch, but the failure to do this did
not discourage him, and while obeying
strictly the orders given, he was keenly
aware of everything which might be of
benefit.</p>

<p>He heard the men discussing what they
would do in case of a failure to find a boat
near by where they gained the shore, and
learned that in such an event one of them
would return to the landing-place to get the
craft of which they knew, with the idea that
a single oarsman would not be molested
while pulling leisurely up stream as if bent
on business of his own.</p>

<p>He also understood that it was the purpose
of his captors, after warning the garrison at
Crown Point, to muster a force of Loyalists
<span id="pg_201" class="page_anchor">201 </span>
from the immediate vicinity, and march into
Sudbury with the idea of taking Captain
Baker and his men prisoners before a second
messenger should be sent from Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>There seemed little hope that such information
could avail him, and yet he was in a
certain degree elated because of having
gained it.</p>

<p>On arriving at the shore of the lake, where
the men had thought it possible a boat might
be found, no craft of any kind was to be
seen.</p>

<p>The wind still held strongly from the
north, and Jason Wentworth announced in a
tone of satisfaction:</p>

<p>“The rebels won’t get very far on their
journey toward Crown Point this day, and I
am mistaken if the wind doesn’t freshen
after sunset.”</p>

<span id="pg_202" class="page_anchor">202 </span>

<p>“It will be precious hard work for us to
make our way against such a breeze,” Ezra
Jones grumbled.</p>

<p>“Ay; but we can do it with four oars out,
and even though we pull at them twenty-four
hours, the labor should count as
nothing so that we arrive in good time.”</p>

<p>“But the garrison there is weak?”</p>

<p>“They should be able to hold out until
assistance can arrive. We can muster fifty
men for them within two hours; but standing
here talking isn’t doing the work, and
it’s important we set off without unnecessary
delay. Ezra, you go down the shore, and
Matthew up, each searching for a boat, and
when one has been found pull to this point,
where I will stay with the prisoners.”</p>

<p>“Is it to your mind that I shall take the
craft from opposite the fort, running the risk
of being overhauled?”</p>

<span id="pg_203" class="page_anchor">203 </span>

<p>“Better that than remain here wasting
time in talk.”</p>

<p>Matthew White was of the opinion that it
would be wisest to make the journey afoot
rather than take the risk of being overhauled
by the “rebels;” but to this Master Wentworth
would not listen, and, he evidently
being the leader of the party, carried his
point.</p>

<p>The two men set out, and immediately
after their departure Jason Wentworth
ordered his prisoners back into the underbrush
a short distance from the shore, where
he stood guard over them, and at the same
time could keep close watch for the return
of his companions.</p>

<span id="pg_204" class="page_anchor">204 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-9">CHAPTER IX.
<span class="title">A BOLD STROKE.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Isaac’s</span> heart beat hard and fast when he
and Nathan were thus left with but a single
man to guard them, for he believed the time
had come when they might succeed in turning
the tables, because surely it would be
easier to overpower one than three.</p>

<p>In this, however, he soon came to understand
that he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Had either of the others been left on guard
it is possible something might have been
done; but Jason Wentworth was not a man
to be caught napping, and while he seemingly
directed his gaze out over the waters,
at the slightest movement of either of the
<span id="pg_205" class="page_anchor">205 </span>
prisoners he was on the alert against an
attempt at escape.</p>

<p>Twice had Isaac changed his position in
order to make certain the man was keeping
close watch upon them when his attention
was apparently directed elsewhere, and each
time he saw Master Wentworth’s musket
raised that it might be ready in case a bullet
was needed to check the flight of his
captives.</p>

<p>“You had better not try that again,” the
man said warningly when Isaac shifted his
position the third time for no other reason
than to make himself more comfortable.
“In a case like this your lives count as
nothing, and while I am unwilling to leave
you to starve in the woods, I shall not hesitate
to kill either or both, therefore do not
make any feint at giving me the slip lest my
patience should become exhausted.”</p>

<span id="pg_206" class="page_anchor">206 </span>

<p>After that Isaac was exceedingly careful,
as was young Beman, to remain silent and
motionless.</p>

<p>While Corporal ’Lige’s recruit was ready to
encounter serious danger in order to accomplish
his ends, there was no idea in his mind
of risking life needlessly when there was
nothing to be gained.</p>

<p>Young Beman lay face downward, as he
had thrown himself when the halt was called,
giving no heed to the conversation between
his comrade and Master Wentworth, and
Isaac believed young Beman intended
for him to understand that he would
take no part in an effort to effect their
release.</p>

<p>An hour passed and nothing had been
heard from the two who had gone in search
of a boat.</p>

<p>It surely seemed as if they must have met
<span id="pg_207" class="page_anchor">207 </span>
with some mishap, and a great hope sprang
up in Isaac’s breast.</p>

<p>When thirty minutes more had passed
Master Wentworth’s face gave evidence of
the anxiety which had come upon him, and
he looked toward his prisoners with such an
odd expression that Isaac Rice trembled,
fearing the man was beginning to believe it
would be better to do with them as his
friends had suggested.</p>

<p>Then, when it seemed impossible for Jason
Wentworth longer to control his impatience,
Master White returned as when he departed,
and having the appearance of one who had
walked far and rapidly.</p>

<p>“You found no boat?” Master Wentworth
said interrogatively, and the man replied, as
he seated himself wearily near by the
prisoners:</p>

<p>“I do not believe there is one this side of
<span id="pg_208" class="page_anchor">208 </span>
Crown Point. Most likely the rebels took
good care to gather in every craft that was
to be found within half a dozen miles of
here.”</p>

<p>For the first time since the little party
came to a halt did Nathan evince any interest
in what was going on around him, and now
he partially turned as if to speak.</p>

<p>Isaac, believing he was on the point of
telling what he knew regarding the seizure of
boats, covered the boy’s mouth with his
hand, for he was not minded to give the
enemy any information.</p>

<p>Master Wentworth observed the movement,
and evidently would have demanded an
explanation, but for the fact that at this
moment Ezra Jones came up through the
thicket, instead of along the shore.</p>

<p>His report was much like Master White’s.</p>

<p>The boat he had expected to find near the
<span id="pg_209" class="page_anchor">209 </span>
trail leading to Sudbury was missing, and he
had continued on nearly two miles further,
but without avail.</p>

<p>Again did hope come into Isaac’s desponding
breast.</p>

<p>The boy had believed Master Jones would
surely find the craft in which he and Nathan
had crossed the lake; but fortune favored
the “rebel” cause in that respect at least, for
the man must have turned about, when, by
continuing on a very short distance further,
he would have come upon that for which he
was searching.</p>

<p>“We must go on foot,” Master Wentworth
said after a short pause, “and the sooner we
set out the better.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for you, who have been
resting here, to say that,” Jones replied
petulantly. “I’ve been making a road
through the thicket for a matter of five miles
<span id="pg_210" class="page_anchor">210 </span>
or more, and don’t propose to move again
until after I’ve had a breathing spell.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come back by the shore,
as you went?”</p>

<p>“Because there are a hundred pair of eyes
watching this side of the lake. I could see
the rebels on the opposite shore before I
gained the trail, and then it was necessary to
keep well hidden in the bushes. Even
though I had found a boat, it is doubtful if I
should have been allowed to pull up this
way, for Seth Warner and Ethan Allen are
much too keen to let any one pass who is
headed in the direction of Crown Point.”</p>

<p>“They are waiting for the wind to die away
before setting out to take the fort, and if we
would save it to the king it is time to be
about the work,” Master Wentworth said
half to himself, but his comrades gave no
heed to the words.</p>

<span id="pg_211" class="page_anchor">211 </span>

<p>Then ensued a long time of silence, and
Isaac was well content, for each moment of
delay lessened the danger, as he believed.</p>

<p>Thanks to the indolence of Masters White
and Jones, it was nearly nightfall before
they were ready to begin the journey, and
then the latter intimated that he had recovered
from his fatigue.</p>

<p>“If we fail to give the warning in time,
you and White can take the fault to yourselves,”
Master Wentworth said angrily, after
which he ordered the prisoners on in advance
once more.</p>

<p>“They have begun to quarrel among themselves,
and perhaps our time will come
before morning,” Isaac whispered to Nathan
as they pushed on in advance, and young
Beman appeared more willing to listen than
when the subject was first broached; but yet
he made no reply.</p>

<span id="pg_212" class="page_anchor">212 </span>

<p>An hour later night had fully come, and
the flying clouds so completely obscured the
sky that it was difficult for the travelers to
make their way even along the shore where
was nothing, save here and there a point of
rocks, to impede the progress.</p>

<p>More than once did the boys walk directly
into the water, and twice Master White fell
headlong over a fallen tree, despite all
efforts to the contrary, and then it was
Jason Wentworth who proposed a halt.</p>

<p>“We are not making two miles an hour at
this rate,” he said in the tone of one who is
offended with his companions. “We may as
well stop where we are until it is light
enough for us to see the way.”</p>

<p>Nathan and Isaac came to a halt immediately,
and, ordering them to keep close by
his side, the leader of the party sought for a
camping-place amid the shrubbery.</p>

<span id="pg_213" class="page_anchor">213 </span>

<p>It was not possible to make any choice
selection while it was so dark that one could
not distinguish objects a dozen paces in
advance, and at the first cleared space sufficiently
large to admit of the men stretching
out at full length, Master Wentworth made
his preparations for the night.</p>

<p>He ordered the boys to lie down; covered
them with four or five saplings, and on the
ends of these he and Master White laid themselves
in such manner that the first movement
made by the prisoners must awaken
the captors.</p>

<p>It was the Indian method of guarding
captives; but, owing to the absence of robes
or blankets with which to cover the ends of
the saplings, those who lay on the outside
had a most uncomfortable bed.</p>

<p>Isaac, still on the alert for any advantage,
observed, rather by sense of hearing than of
<span id="pg_214" class="page_anchor">214 </span>
sight, that Master Wentworth kept his musket
close beside him, while the other two
leaned their weapons against the bushes.</p>

<p>It seemed to Corporal ’Lige’s recruit as if
Nathan Beman had finally come to understand
that escape might yet be possible, for
the latter prodded his comrade with his
elbow from time to time, as if to prevent him
from falling asleep, and Isaac returned the
pressure with vigor.</p>

<p>Then, when it appeared as if fully an hour
had passed, the heavy breathing of the men
told that they were fast asleep, and Nathan
whispered cautiously:</p>

<p>“These fellows ain’t so smart as I’d
counted on. I’ve heard father tell how he
outwitted the savages when they had him in
the same kind of a trap, an’ I can work this
if you’re ready.”</p>

<p>“Begin at once; there is no time to lose.”</p>

<span id="pg_215" class="page_anchor">215 </span>

<p>Then it was that young Beman breathed
loudly as if wrapped in profound slumber,
and tossed about restlessly, all the while
pressing against Master White.</p>

<p>Isaac did not understand the purpose of
such maneuver, but he was content with knowing
that his comrade had at last consented to
make an effort toward escape.</p>

<p>More than once Master White partially
awakened, and grumbled because of Nathan’s
restlessness; but at the same moment he
unconsciously moved aside slightly, and each
time he did this the prisoners were so much
nearer liberty.</p>

<p>Then came the time when Nathan whispered:</p>

<p>“He has at last rolled off the saplings, and
I can crawl away without disturbing him.
Are you ready to follow?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Can’t you get the muskets? Two
<span id="pg_216" class="page_anchor">216 </span>
are near our feet, and the other is by the
side of Wentworth.”</p>

<p>“It is enough if we give them the slip.”</p>

<p>“If we get possession of the muskets they
cannot send a bullet after us in case one
awakens before we are well off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try it,” Nathan replied as he began
wriggling his body out from under the saplings,
not daring to move in the direction of
where Master White lay.</p>

<p>Isaac, literally trembling with excitement,
followed his example, and it seemed to him
as if half an hour had been consumed in the
task, when really no more than five minutes
were thus spent before the boys were on
their feet and the men apparently still
wrapped in slumber.</p>

<p>Even now Nathan would have made good
his escape without an effort to secure the
weapons, and pressed his comrade’s arm to
<span id="pg_217" class="page_anchor">217 </span>
intimate that there was no time to be lost;
but Isaac, dropping to his hands and knees,
crept toward Master Wentworth.</p>

<p>When the plan had so far succeeded that
they were on their feet, a bold scheme came
into Isaac’s head, and he believed now was
come the time for him to gain the good
opinion of Corporal ’Lige, if he should be so
fortunate as to see the old soldier again.</p>

<p>Moving with infinite care, and giving no
heed to what Nathan might be doing, the
boy crept to Master Wentworth’s side, and it
was with difficulty he repressed a cry of exultation
as his fingers closed over the musket.</p>

<p>Cautiously rising to his feet, and at the
same instant assuring himself the flint was in
place, but forgetting that he had no powder
with which to prime the weapon, Isaac
stepped back to where he had left his
comrade.</p>

<span id="pg_218" class="page_anchor">218 </span>

<p>Nathan was no longer there, but from a
short distance away came a slight rustling of
the foliage, and Isaac waited, his heart beating
so violently that it seemed positive the
thumping must awaken their enemies.</p>

<p>Before Corporal ’Lige’s recruit could have
counted twenty, Nathan stood by his side,
and it needed but one touch of the hand to
tell the former that all the weapons had
been secured.</p>

<p>Young Beman had done his work well, for
he not only held the two muskets, but a
powder-horn well filled, and a shot pouch
heavy with bullets.</p>

<p>Now it was that, having all the advantage,
Nathan began to be sensible of a glow
of patriotism, and he whispered to his comrade
as he carefully primed one of the
muskets:</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be a hard task to take these
<span id="pg_219" class="page_anchor">219 </span>
fellows into Sudbury, if we had something
with which to fetter their hands.”</p>

<p>“My mother made the cloth of this coat I
am wearing, and I promise that it’s as strong
as a rope.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply Isaac began
stripping the garment into narrow bands, by
aid of his teeth, and the noise caused Master
Wentworth to half rise as he cried:</p>

<p>“Hey! White! Jones!”</p>

<p>“Stay where you are!” Nathan shouted.
“We’ve got all the muskets, and are in the
mood to shoot if you make any trouble. It
won’t go much against the grain to put a
couple of bullets into the two who wanted to
leave us trussed up in the thicket, where we
would starve to death!”</p>

<p>Master Wentworth sank back upon the
ground very quickly, and at the same instant
must have discovered that his ammunition
<span id="pg_220" class="page_anchor">220 </span>
had not been seized, for he cried to his
companions:</p>

<p>“They can’t prime the muskets, and it is
the same——”</p>

<p>“You’ll know whether we can or not if
you make any move! Don’t think we were
such fools as to forget that part of the business!
I’ve got all the powder and balls
that’ll be needed to give you three a solid
dose. Tie Master Wentworth’s hands behind
his back, Isaac, and if he so much as winks
while you are doing it I’ll quiet him. Lie
down!” he added fiercely as in the dim light
he saw one of the others attempting to rise.
“If you make any fuss we’ll shoot first an’
talk afterward!”</p>

<p>It was more than probable one of the men
might, because of the darkness, have gotten
off without injury; but each knew that
should such an attempt be made Nathan
<span id="pg_221" class="page_anchor">221 </span>
could shoot down perhaps two of the party,
and each probably feared it might be himself
who would receive the bullet.</p>

<p>Therefore it was that they obeyed young
Beman’s orders strictly, and as soon as might
be Master Wentworth was lying on his face
with both hands tied securely behind his
back.</p>

<p>To fetter the others in the same fashion
was neither a long nor a difficult task,
because, like the bullies they were, both
showed the white feather when danger threatened
their precious selves, and no more than
fifteen minutes had elapsed from the time
Nathan first set about making the attempt at
escape before the prisoners were powerless
for harm.</p>

<p>With their hands thus securely lashed
behind them, it was impossible for the men
to rise without assistance, and while Nathan
<span id="pg_222" class="page_anchor">222 </span>
stood with the musket raised that he might
shoot at the first show of resistance, Isaac
helped the prisoners to their feet.</p>

<p>“Now it is you three who will obey our
orders, instead of knocking us about,” <ins title="Note: “Young” in the original">young</ins>
Beman said gleefully, “and I’ll make the
same threat Master Wentworth did: At the
first show of trying to escape, I’ll shoot, an’
even though it is dark, there’s little chance
of missing aim, for we shall keep close in the
rear. Take one musket, Isaac, and the other
we’ll leave here, rather than hamper ourselves
by too much of a burden.”</p>

<p>“Do you count on trying to make your
way through the thicket while it is so
dark?” Ezra Jones asked in a surly tone.</p>

<p>“That’s what we shall do.”</p>

<p>“Then you may as well shoot us offhand,
for if it was hard work when we were free,
what chance have we with our hands tied?”</p>

<span id="pg_223" class="page_anchor">223 </span>

<p>“If you think that is the best plan I’ll
follow your advice, and never so much as
wince in the doing of it, for you was one
who would have left us to starve,” Nathan
said so promptly that the man involuntarily
ducked his head as if fearing a bullet might
follow the words.</p>

<p>“Where are you bent on taking us?” Jason
Wentworth asked, after he had somewhat
recovered his composure.</p>

<p>“Our orders were to go to Sudbury, and I
think we’d better keep on in that direction,
rather than lose time by carrying you to
Ticonderoga. We could do that last if we
pleased, for our boat is hidden among the
bushes nearabout where Master Jones turned
back. What say you, Isaac Rice? Is it to
be Sudbury, or the fort?”</p>

<p>“It is best we see Captain Baker as soon
as may be, and if you think we can find our
<span id="pg_224" class="page_anchor">224 </span>
way through the woods, I’ll say nothing
against a short cut, for time presses.”</p>

<p>The prisoners were driven like sheep, both
boys marching directly behind them with
leveled muskets, and, as may be expected,
the advance was exceedingly slow.</p>

<p>The men stumbled over fallen trees, and
each of them fell headlong half a dozen
times before the seemingly long night came
to an end; but still they were urged on at
the best possible pace until sunrise, when a
brief halt was made.</p>

<p>Two hours after the journey had been
resumed the trail was found, and from that
time on until the outskirts of the settlement
was gained, the party marched at a reasonably
rapid rate of speed.</p>

<p>Once a glimpse of Sudbury was had Isaac
became exceedingly prudent, and insisted
upon calling a halt, while Nathan declared
<span id="pg_225" class="page_anchor">225 </span>
they should press forward until the prisoners
could be delivered to Captain Baker.</p>

<p>“I shan’t feel comfortable in mind until all
three are off our hands, for there’s no knowing
how many friends they may have in the
settlement.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly why I would halt here,”
Isaac replied, and Corporal ’Lige would have
rejoiced had he known how rapidly his
recruit was learning his duties as a soldier.
“We do not know in which house Captain
Baker lives, and while making inquiries, still
having the prisoners with us, we might come
upon those who would turn the tables once
more, before we had so much as gained
speech with the officer.”</p>

<p>“Then what would you do?”</p>

<p>“We are within less than half a mile of the
settlement. Let us march the prisoners into
the thicket, where they will be hidden from
<span id="pg_226" class="page_anchor">226 </span>
view of any who may come this way, and
while one stands guard over them, the other
can seek out the captain. After that has
been done he can take charge of the affair,
and our work will be well and thoroughly
done.”</p>

<p>“Who is to remain here?” Nathan asked.</p>

<p>“It shall be as you say.”</p>

<p>Young Beman remained silent a moment,
and then, with the air of one who has
decided an important question, said:</p>

<p>“You shall go into the settlement, and if
either of these Tories so much as opens his
mouth while you are gone, I’ll put a bullet
through him.”</p>

<p>“And you must not hesitate to carry out
that threat,” Isaac added firmly. “Now is
come the time when we may prevent any
news from being carried to Crown Point, and
at the same moment deliver Colonel Allen’s
<span id="pg_227" class="page_anchor">227 </span>
message, therefore blood must be spilled if
necessary.”</p>

<p>Jones and White looked thoroughly
alarmed, while Jason Wentworth said
approvingly:</p>

<p>“You lads are in the right, from your own
standpoint, which is a wrong one, however;
but since we have been so dull as to let you
get the best of us, <ins title="Note: “is” in the original">it</ins> is but proper we should
pay the penalty for disobeying orders.”</p>

<p>“Will you give us your word not to make
an outcry if any person should pass by on the
trail?” Isaac quietly, having no little respect
for this enemy who could look upon the
situation so fairly.</p>

<p>“If by giving up my life I can prevent the
capture of Crown Point, you may be certain I
shall not hesitate.”</p>

<p>Isaac looked significantly at Nathan, as if
to say that this man should be guarded more
<span id="pg_228" class="page_anchor">228 </span>
closely than the others, and after the
prisoners had been marched into the thicket,
where they were completely hidden from
view, Corporal ’Lige’s recruit set out, Nathan
calling after him:</p>

<p>“Do not loiter by the way, either in going
or coming, for I am not quite at my ease
while alone.”</p>

<p>“Have no fear I shall delay. It should
not be a long task to find Captain Baker, and
most likely you’ll see me again in less than
an hour. Keep your wits about you, and
remember how much mischief may be done
if you hesitate to shoot when it becomes
necessary to do so.”</p>

<span id="pg_229" class="page_anchor">229 </span>

<h2 id="chapter-10">CHAPTER X.
<span class="title">CROWN POINT.</span></h2>

<p><span class="first-word">Never</span> since the moment when Corporal
’Lige had promised to make a soldier of him,
had Isaac Rice been as happy as now.</p>

<p>He had atoned for the mistake made when
they first set out on the journey, although it
was really none of his, and, in addition to
having prevented the news of what had been
done at Ticonderoga from being carried to
Crown Point, had as prisoners three who
could have made no slight amount of trouble
for the colonists.</p>

<p>Surely the old corporal would praise
Nathan and himself, and he glowed with
pride as he thought of the report he could
make on his return to the fort.</p>

<span id="pg_230" class="page_anchor">230 </span>

<p>“Of course Nathan Beman has as big a
share in this work as I, and it is his right;
but I know it was not me who grew faint-hearted
when we were in the power of the
enemy, an’ there’s a deal of satisfaction in
that thought.”</p>

<p>On arriving at Sudbury, half an hour after
having left his comrade, Isaac made inquiries
for Captain Baker’s dwelling, and learned
that had Nathan’s proposition been carried
out, they would have been forced to parade
the prisoners through the entire settlement
before coming upon the house.</p>

<p>The captain was within sound of his wife’s
voice when Isaac finally stood before the
good woman asking to see her husband, and
came up quickly; but with a look of disappointment
on his face when he saw his visitor
was only a boy.</p>

<p>“Is this Captain Remember Baker?” Corporal
<span id="pg_231" class="page_anchor">231 </span>
’Lige’s recruit asked, for he was not
minded any mistake should be made now
that his work was so nearly accomplished.</p>

<p>“Yes; what do you want?”</p>

<p>“I am come from Colonel Allen——”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” the captain asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“That I may not tell you until we are
alone.”</p>

<p>“Come into the house! Come in and
refresh yourself, and you shall tell me that
with which you are charged while partaking
of such food as my wife can prepare
quickly.”</p>

<p>“It is not well for me to spend time in
eating until after Nathan Beman is relieved
from his charge.”</p>

<p>“What have you to do with that young
Tory, if it is true that you come from Ethan
Allen?” and now the captain began to show
signs of being suspicious.</p>

<span id="pg_232" class="page_anchor">232 </span>

<p>“I will tell the whole story, beginning with
the capture of Ticonderoga——”</p>

<p>“So the fort has been taken by our people!”
Captain Baker cried joyously as he
clasped the messenger by the hand with such
force as to make the boy wince. “Tell me
quickly! When was the work done?”</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill-6">
<a href="images/ill-06.jpg"><img src="images/ill-06-min.jpg" alt="Illustration"></a>
<p>“SO THE FORT HAS BEEN TAKEN BY OUR PEOPLE!” CAPTAIN BAKER CRIED,
CLASPING THE MESSENGER BY THE HAND.</p>
<p class="place"><em>Corporal ’Lige’s Recruit, p. 232.</em></p>
</div>

<p>More than once before he had come to the
story of his and Nathan’s adventures was
Isaac interrupted by the eager soldier; but
after a certain time he succeeded in imparting
all the information, and was rewarded by
hearing the captain say:</p>

<p>“You showed rare good sense in leaving
the prisoners outside the settlement, for
while we in Sudbury are with the colonists
in their task of teaching the king a much-needed
lesson, there are some who might
have tried to work mischief had you applied to
them asking the location of my dwelling. Wait
<span id="pg_233" class="page_anchor">233 </span>
here until I can summon a few of the Green
Mountain Boys, who have been awaiting word
from Ethan Allen, and we’ll soon relieve
you of the Tories.”</p>

<p>Captain Baker ran out, not stopping for a
reply, and while he was absent his wife
insisted on Isaac’s eating such food as she
had already prepared, until it seemed to the
boy that he would not need anything more
for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Then six men, each armed with a musket,
arrived, and were ushered into the house, and
Isaac was called upon to tell once more of
how Ticonderoga had been captured, after
which the party set out to find the prisoners.</p>

<p>Corporal ’Lige’s recruit acted the part of
guide, and in less than an hour the three
Tories, having been given a liberal supply of
cornbread, were being marched back on the
trail toward the captured fort.</p>

<span id="pg_234" class="page_anchor">234 </span>

<p>Both Isaac and Nathan believed it was
their duty to accompany the prisoners; but
Captain Baker insisted that they remain at
his home in order to gain the repose which
was needed, promising that they should
arrive at Ticonderoga nearly as soon as if
they had gone with the company escorting
the Tories.</p>

<p>Therefore it was the boys remained, well
content with the work they had performed,
and not until the morning of the twelfth of
May was the return journey begun.</p>

<p>Then the wind was blowing gently from
the southward, and Nathan said mournfully:</p>

<p>“We have of a surety lost the chance of
going to Crown Point, for the hunter will be
up and doing this morning, and is likely well
on his way by this time.”</p>

<p>Overhearing his words the captain added:</p>

<p>“Ay, lad if he didn’t get there yesterday,
<span id="pg_235" class="page_anchor">235 </span>
which I misdoubt, you may count that he
started before daybreak this morning; but
you can have the satisfaction of knowing
that save for your work, his task might not
be so easy.”</p>

<p>“Think you he can surprise the garrison?”
Isaac asked.</p>

<p>“I see no reason why it should not be done,
especially after your capture of the Tories,
for thus far Colonel Allen has succeeded in
keeping his movements a secret, at least
from the people in this section of the
country, and why may you not say the same
of Crown Point?”</p>

<p>To the surprise of the boys no less than
twenty men were assembled in front of Captain
Baker’s house by the time breakfast had
been eaten, and on making inquiry Isaac
learned that these were all of the Green
Mountain Boys who had been ordered by
<span id="pg_236" class="page_anchor">236 </span>
their leader to rendezvous at Sudbury until
summoned elsewhere.</p>

<p>The company, under command of Captain
Baker, took up the line of march over an old
trail through the woods, marching to a point
on the shore of the lake nearly two miles
further down from where the boys had
landed, when they came from the fort.</p>

<p>There, snugly hidden in the thicket ready
for just such an emergency as had already
come, were found four stout boats, each
capable of carrying not less than a dozen
men, and after all were embarked and the
little fleet pushed off from the shore, it
appeared quite formidable.</p>

<p>Each craft boasted of a sail, and with the
wind from the southward there was no need
of labor at the oars, therefore this portion of
the journey promised to be most pleasant.</p>

<p>“This is different from what we expected
<span id="pg_237" class="page_anchor">237 </span>
when Master Wentworth marched us in front
of his musket,” Isaac said in a tone of content,
and his comrade replied:</p>

<p>“We got out of a small hole in fine
style.”</p>

<p>It was when they were midway from the
point of embarkation to Fort Ticonderoga
that young Beman cried excitedly, pointing
toward that shore which they had just
quitted, where could be seen two small
boats laden with men who were pulling into
a cove as if seeking shelter:</p>

<p>“It looks to me as if those fellows are
wearing red coats!”</p>

<p>It was the first intimation Captain Baker
had that there were others in the immediate
vicinity, and instantly he gave word for the
boats to be hauled around for the purpose of
learning who these strangers were.</p>

<p>Hardly had this maneuver been executed
<span id="pg_238" class="page_anchor">238 </span>
when one of the men announced positively
that young Beman was right in his
conjecture.</p>

<p>“They are most likely Britishers, who
escaped from Ticonderoga, or have come
from Crown Point on their way to St. John in
search of reinforcements,” Captain Baker
cried excitedly, and orders were given for the
men to take to the oars.</p>

<p>Then ensued a chase which was quickly
ended, owing to the precaution taken by the
Britishers themselves.</p>

<p>They had put into the cove hoping to
escape detection, and it proved to be a trap
for them.</p>

<p>No sooner were the boats arrived off this
place of refuge than Captain Baker gave
orders for them to be strung out in line, thus
cutting off all hope of escape by water, and
in his own craft pulled near to where the two
<span id="pg_239" class="page_anchor">239 </span>
boats, manned by seven soldiers, were drawn
up as if prepared to do battle.</p>

<p>It was soon evident they understood well
the truth of the old adage that “discretion is
the better part of valor,” for immediately
Captain Baker called upon them to surrender,
they threw their arms into the
bottom of the boat in token of submission.</p>

<p>Nathan was most grievously disappointed.
He had fancied there might be a skirmish, or
at least an exchange of shots, for until the
morning when Ticonderoga was taken so
readily he had believed the king’s soldiers to
be invincible, and even now he was not prepared
to see them surrender to a force little
more than four times their number.</p>

<p>The prisoners readily answered the questions
put by the captain.</p>

<p>They were from Crown Point, and having
learned of the surrender of Ticonderoga had
<span id="pg_240" class="page_anchor">240 </span>
been dispatched by the sergeant in command
of the garrison, for reinforcements.</p>

<p>They stated, in addition, that it was not
believed those who had taken Ticonderoga
would push on to Crown Point immediately,
consequently plenty of time remained in
which that post might be reinforced. Therefore
it was the sergeant in command had not
hesitated to weaken his small garrison by
thus sending seven men on a mission which
might more readily have been accomplished
by one.</p>

<p>“There is yet time for us to do Seth Warner
a good turn,” Captain Baker cried sufficiently
loud for all his men to hear. “It is
more than likely the garrison at Crown Point
will hold out when the Green Mountain Boys
demand its surrender, believing reinforcements
are, or speedily will be, on the way.
Now, instead of stopping at Ticonderoga, our
<span id="pg_241" class="page_anchor">241 </span>
plan is to push directly on to the fort, and
when it is known that we have captured the
messengers I reckon the fortification will be
surrendered with but little parley.”</p>

<p>Although the captain had thus spoken as if
making a suggestion, his men understood
that his words were little short of a command,
and after transferring the prisoners
the fleet was gotten under way.</p>

<p>Thanks to the freshening wind the boats
were soon making good time in the race to
overtake the force led by Seth Warner.</p>

<p>“And it is to be Crown Point for us, after
all!” Nathan cried exultantly, whereat,
hearing the words, Captain Baker asked:</p>

<p>“What is your name, lad?”</p>

<p>“Nathan Beman from Shoreham.”</p>

<p>“So? I knew your father was on the right
side; but understood that you and your
mother were hardly to be trusted.”</p>

<span id="pg_242" class="page_anchor">242 </span>

<p>“I cannot say anything for mother; but
since I have seen the king’s soldiers surrender
so readily I am with the Green Mountain
Boys and those who share their
opinions.”</p>

<p>“When you are so nearly with them as to
enlist, come to me, lad, and I will give you a
musket in the best company that can be
found this side of Cambridge.”</p>

<p>Isaac looked at his new friend reproachfully,
and the latter said with a laugh:</p>

<p>“I know all you are thinking; but when I
enlist, and it ain’t certain but that I shall do
so soon if the people continue to hold out
against the king, I propose to set my name
down for that company to which you
belong.”</p>

<p>“Do so when we go back to the fort,”
Isaac cried gleefully, “and side by side you
and I will see many a brave adventure.”</p>

<span id="pg_243" class="page_anchor">243 </span>

<p>“But the trouble is we may see more than
will be pleasing, though I truly believe I
shall enlist.”</p>

<p>“And Corporal ’Lige shall teach us both a
soldier’s duty.”</p>

<p>This proposition apparently did not meet
with favor, for Nathan at once changed the
subject of the conversation by inquiring
regarding the probable condition of affairs
at Crown Point, after which the boys listened
to the conversation of their companions as
they spoke of Lexington and Concord, and
of what should be done to avenge the
murders committed there.</p>

<p>And now it came to pass that these two
lads were most grievously disappointed in
their anticipations concerning the capture of
the fort.</p>

<p>Probably each had in his mind the thought
that he was to see somewhat of war, more at
<span id="pg_244" class="page_anchor">244 </span>
least than had been witnessed at Ticonderoga;
but it was not to be.</p>

<p>As the little fleet approached the point,
Warner and his men were just disembarking.</p>

<p>Although Captain Baker’s party was but a
mile away at that time, when they gained
the shore the garrison had been surrendered
without the firing of a gun, and the booming
of the cannon told that again were the “imitation
soldiers” successful in their efforts to
teach his majesty a lesson.</p>

<p>One hundred and fourteen cannon, of
which sixty-one were fit for service, were
among the spoils on this morning, and after
having made up a list of such goods as were
found in the fort, Seth Warner did the two
lads the great favor of sending them to Colonel
Allen with the news of the bloodless
victory.</p>

<p>“Go you on ahead, lads,” Captain Baker
<span id="pg_245" class="page_anchor">245 </span>
said when the boys had been intrusted with
the message. “I won’t spoil a good fortune
by seeming to accompany you; but will
linger here until you are well on the way,
and after having given Ethan Allen the best
news he could possibly receive at such a
critical time, I very much question whether
you may not ask whatsoever you will from
him.”</p>

<p>Hurriedly the messengers departed in order
that they might arrive well in advance of
Captain Baker’s company, and when they
were pulling down the lake, Isaac said
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“You heard what Captain Baker said, that
Colonel Allen might grant anything we
asked?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I know what is in your mind
this minute.”</p>

<p>“Name it then.”</p>

<span id="pg_246" class="page_anchor">246 </span>

<p>“You think I am counting on asking him
for money.”</p>

<p>Isaac’s face flushed and he made no reply.</p>

<p>“I might have done so a few days ago, but
now I am coming around on the same track
with father, and say that the colonists do
right in resisting the king. If it so be he
permits, I will enlist this day.”</p>

<p>And Nathan Beman kept his promise, even
going so far as to desire Corporal ’Lige
should stand sponsor for him when, the message
having been delivered, Colonel Allen
thanked them again and again for the
cheering intelligence and asked what they
would choose as their reward.</p>

<p>“Only the permission to enlist,” Nathan
said, and the colonel stared at him in open-mouthed
astonishment for several seconds,
after which he asked with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Are you not the same lad who so thirsted
<span id="pg_247" class="page_anchor">247 </span>
for money that he refused to show the way
into the fort unless first paid for his
services?”</p>

<p>“Ay, sir; but I have come to think differently
since then, and now I’m going for a
soldier, because it looks to me as if the
colonists would speedily worst the king.”</p>

<p>“Whereas a few days ago it appeared to
you that the boot was on the other foot?”</p>

<p>“I did not think farmers could be turned
into soldiers, sir.”</p>

<p>“You may readily believe it now, lad,
more especially since you have seen how
easy it is for one who was almost a royalist
to become a good American, and now I am
speaking of yourself. Enlist wherever you
will, and I will take it upon myself to see
that both you lads rise in the service as
rapidly as you shall deserve.”</p>

<span class="name">G. A. Henty</span>. With 12 full-page Illustrations by <span class="name">Gordon

<p>The adventures of the son of a Scotch officer in French service.
The boy, brought up by a Glasgow bailie, is arrested for aiding a
Jacobite agent, escapes, is wrecked on the French coast, reaches
Paris, and serves with the French army at Dettingen. He kills
his father’s foe in a duel, and escaping to the coast, shares the
adventures of Prince Charlie, but finally settles happily in Scotland.</p>

<p class="review">“Ronald, the hero, is very like the hero of ‘Quentin Durward.’ The lad’s
journey across France, and his hairbreadth escapes, make up as good a narrative
of the kind as we have ever read. For freshness of treatment and

<p>The period between the landing of Clive as a young writer in
India and the close of his career was critical and eventful in the
extreme. At its commencement the English were traders existing
on sufferance of the native princes. At its close they were masters
of Bengal and of the greater part of Southern India. The author
has given a full and accurate account of the events of that stirring
time, and battles and sieges follow each other in rapid succession,
while he combines with his narrative a tale of daring and adventure,
which gives a lifelike interest to the volume.</p>

<p class="review">“He has taken a period of Indian history of the most vital importance,
and he has embroidered on the historical facts a story which of itself is deeply
interesting. Young people assuredly will be delighted with the volume.”—<em>Scotsman.</em></p>

<p>In this story Mr. Henty gives the history of the first part of the
Thirty Years’ War. The issue had its importance, which has extended
to the present day, as it established religious freedom

<p>In this story the author gives an account of the fierce struggle
between Saxon and Dane for supremacy in England, and presents
a vivid picture of the misery and ruin to which the country was
reduced by the ravages of the sea-wolves. The hero, a young
Saxon thane, takes part in all the battles fought by King Alfred.
He is driven from his home, takes to the sea and resists the Danes
on their own element, and being pursued by them up the Seine,
is present at the long and desperate siege of Paris.</p>

<p>Boys reading the history of the Punic Wars have seldom a keen
appreciation of the merits of the contest. That it was at first a
struggle for empire, and afterward for existence on the part of
Carthage, that Hannibal was a great and skillful general, that he
defeated the Romans at Trebia, Lake Trasimenus, and Cannæ,
and all but took Rome, represents pretty nearly the sum total of
their knowledge. To let them know more about this momentous
struggle for the empire of the world Mr. Henty has written this
story, which not only gives in graphic style a brilliant description
of a most interesting period of history, but is a tale of exciting
adventure sure to secure the interest of the reader.</p>

<p class="review">“Well constructed and vividly told. From first to last nothing stays the
interest of the narrative. It bears us along as on a stream whose current

Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations by <span class="name">Gordon Browne</span>.
12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>

<p>In this story the author relates the stirring tale of the Scottish
War of Independence. The extraordinary valor and personal
prowess of Wallace and Bruce rival the deeds of the mythical
heroes of chivalry, and indeed at one time Wallace was ranked
with these legendary personages. The researches of modern
historians have shown, however, that he was a living, breathing
man—and a valiant champion. The hero of the tale fought under
both Wallace and Bruce, and while the strictest historical accuracy
has been maintained with respect to public events, the work is
full of “hairbreadth ’scapes” and wild adventure.</p>

<p class="review">“It is written in the author’s best style. Full of the wildest and most remarkable
achievements, it is a tale of great interest, which a boy, once he has
begun it, will not willingly put on one side.”—<em>The Schoolmaster.</em></p>

<p>The story of a young Virginian planter, who, after bravely
proving his sympathy with the slaves of brutal masters, serves
with no less courage and enthusiasm under Lee and Jackson
through the most exciting events of the struggle. He has many
hairbreadth escapes, is several times wounded and twice taken
prisoner; but his courage and readiness and, in two cases, the
devotion of a black servant and of a runaway slave whom he had
assisted, bring him safely through all difficulties.</p>

<p>The story of two English lads who go to Holland as pages in
the service of one of “the fighting Veres.” After many adventures
by sea and land, one of the lads finds himself on board a

<p>The conquest of Mexico by a small band of resolute men under
the magnificent leadership of Cortez is always rightly ranked
among the most romantic and daring exploits in history. With
this as the groundwork of his story Mr. Henty has interwoven the
adventures of an English youth, Roger Hawkshaw, the sole survivor
of the good ship Swan, which had sailed from a Devon port
to challenge the mercantile supremacy of the Spaniards in the
New World. He is beset by many perils among the natives, but
is saved by his own judgment and strength, and by the devotion
of an Aztec princess. At last by a ruse he obtains the protection
of the Spaniards, and after the fall of Mexico he succeeds in regaining
his native shore, with a fortune and a charming Aztec
bride.</p>

<p>Harry Sandwith, a Westminster boy, becomes a resident at the

There the girls are condemned to death in the coffin-ships,
but are saved by the unfailing courage of their boy protector.</p>

<p>In the present volume Mr. Henty gives an account of the struggle
between Britain and France for supremacy in the North
American continent. On the issue of this war depended not only
the destinies of North America, but to a large extent those of the
mother countries themselves. The fall of Quebec decided that
the Anglo-Saxon race should predominate in the New World;
that Britain, and not France, should take the lead among the
nations of Europe; and that English and American commerce, the
English language, and English literature, should spread right
round the globe.</p>

American and British soldiers have been engaged did they behave

<p>There is something fascinating to the average youth in the very
idea of buried treasure. A vision arises before his eyes of swarthy
Portuguese and Spanish rascals, with black beards and gleaming
eyes—sinister-looking fellows who once on a time haunted the
Spanish Main, sneaking out from some hidden creek in their long,
low schooner, of picaroonish rake and sheer, to attack an unsuspecting
trading craft. There were many famous sea rovers in
their day, but none more celebrated than Capt. Kidd. Perhaps
the most fascinating tale of all is Mr. Fitts’ true story of an adventurous
American boy, who receives from his dying father an
ancient bit of vellum, which the latter obtained in a curious way.
The document bears obscure directions purporting to locate a certain
island in the Bahama group, and a considerable treasure
buried there by two of Kidd’s crew. The hero of this book,
Paul Jones Garry, is an ambitious, persevering lad, of salt-water
New England ancestry, and his efforts to reach the island and

Philip Garland, a young animal collector and trainer, of

Henty</span>. With full-page Illustrations. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>

<p>A story which will give young readers an unsurpassed insight
into the customs of the Egyptian people. Amuba, a prince of the
Rebu nation, is carried with his charioteer Jethro into slavery.
They become inmates of the house of Ameres, the Egyptian high-priest,
and are happy in his service until the priest’s son accidentally
kills the sacred cat of Bubastes. In an outburst of popular
fury Ameres is killed, and it rests with Jethro and Amuba to
secure the escape of the high-priest’s son and daughter.</p>

<p class="review">“The story, from the critical moment of the killing of the sacred cat to the
perilous exodus into Asia with which it closes, is very skillfully constructed

<p class="title"><strong>With Washington at Monmouth</strong>: A Story of Three Philadelphia
Boys. By <span class="name">James Otis</span>. 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>

<p>Three Philadelphia boys, Seth Graydon “whose mother conducted
a boarding-house which was patronized by the British
officers;” Enoch Ball, “son of that Mrs. Ball whose dancing
school was situated on Letitia Street,” and little Jacob, son of
“Chris, the Baker,” serve as the principal characters. The
story is laid during the winter when Lord Howe held possession
of the city, and the lads aid the cause by assisting the American
spies who make regular and frequent visits from Valley Forge.
One reads here of home-life in the captive city when bread was
scarce among the people of the lower classes, and a reckless prodigality
shown by the British officers, who passed the winter in
feasting and merry-making while the members of the patriot army
but a few miles away were suffering from both cold and hunger.
The story abounds with pictures of Colonial life skillfully
drawn, and the glimpses of Washington’s soldiers which are given
show that the work has not been hastily done, or without considerable
study.</p>

In a land where the Royal Bengal tiger runs at large;

<p>A “down-east” plucky lad who ships as cabin boy, not from

Ned Rogers hears the captain and mate discussing their plans for

<p>This tale smacks of the salt sea. It is just the kind of story
that the majority of boys yearn for. From the moment that the
Sea Queen dispenses with the services of the tug in lower New
York bay till the breeze leaves her becalmed off the coast of
Florida, one can almost hear the whistle of the wind through her
rigging, the creak of her straining cordage as she heels to the
leeward, and feel her rise to the snow-capped waves which her
sharp bow cuts into twin streaks of foam. Off Marquesas Keys
she floats in a dead calm. Ben Clark, the hero of the story, and
Jake, the cook, spy a turtle asleep upon the glassy surface of the
water. They determine to capture him, and take a boat for that
purpose, and just as they succeed in catching him a thick fog
cuts them off from the vessel, and then their troubles begin.
They take refuge on board a drifting hulk, a storm arises and they
are cast ashore upon a low sandy key. Their adventures from

<p>The two boys are from Portsmouth, N. H., and are introduced
in August, 1781, when on the point of leaving home to enlist in
Col. Scammell’s regiment, then stationed near New York City.
Their method of traveling is on horseback, and the author has

are sent as messengers—not soldiers—into the south to find the

<p class="title"><strong>Tom the Bootblack</strong>; or, The Road to Success. By <span class="name">Horatio
Alger, Jr.</span> 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>

<p>A bright, enterprising lad was Tom the bootblack. He was
not at all ashamed of his humble calling, though always on the
lookout to better himself. His guardian, old Jacob Morton, died,
leaving him a small sum of money and a written confession that
Tom, instead of being of humble origin, was the son and heir of
a deceased Western merchant, and had been defrauded out of his
just rights by an unscrupulous uncle. The lad started for Cincinnati
to look up his heritage. But three years passed away
before he obtained his first clue. Mr. Grey, the uncle, did not
hesitate to employ a ruffian to kill the lad. The plan failed, and
Gilbert Grey, once Tom the bootblack, came into a comfortable
fortune. This is one of Mr. Alger’s best stories.</p>

up pursuit and the expedition arrives at the coast without further
trouble. Mr. Prentice has a delightful method of blending fact
with fiction. He tells exactly how wild-beast collectors secure
specimens on their native stamping grounds, and these descriptions
make very entertaining reading.</p>

<p class="title"><strong>Joe’s Luck</strong>: A Boy’s Adventures in California. By <span class="name">Horatio
Alger, Jr.</span> 12mo, cloth, price $1.00.</p>

<p>Without a doubt Joe Mason was a lucky boy, but he deserved
the golden chances that fell to his lot, for he had the pluck and
ambition to push himself to the front. Joe had but one dollar in
the world when he stood despondently on the California Mail
Steamship Co.’s dock in New York watching the preparations incident
to the departure of the steamer. The same dollar was
still Joe’s entire capital when he landed in the bustling town of
tents and one-story cabins—the San Francisco of ’51, and inside
of the week the boy was proprietor of a small restaurant earning a
comfortable profit. The story is chock full of stirring incidents,
while the amusing situations are furnished by Joshua Bickford,
from Pumpkin Hollow, and the fellow who modestly styles himself
the “Rip-tail Roarer, from Pike Co., Missouri.” Mr. Alger
never writes a poor book, and “Joe’s Luck” is certainly one of
his best.</p>

<p>The daughter of a gentleman, who had married a poor Swiss

self-sacrificing, and, as all good women nowadays are, largely
touched with enthusiasm of humanity. The illustrations are unusually good.
